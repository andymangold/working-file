What has been your transition? What are things that are most surprising to you, or... I'm just curious to see the other side, cause I've never worked for a government of any kind. So, I'm interested to see how this changes. How you perceive the changes? </div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="0:03:03">0:03:03</button><div class="speaker">Chappell</div><div class="message-content">Right. So, I worked as a digital communications manager for the City of New York for a little over three years, and then I transitioned over to agency life. And it was honestly culture shock for me. Cause the three years I spent at the city, that was the first full-time, benefits job I had, and I learned so much about actually having a job and being professional and leading meetings, all that kind of stuff that you really should learn at some point.</div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="0:03:41">0:03:41</button><div class="speaker">Chappell</div><div class="message-content">But switching over to the agency life, honestly, the day I walked in the door, I was just kind of in shock, in a good way and a bad way. Cause I was excited to be in an agency where you have all these amazing creative people, and there are dogs everywhere, and people are drinking beer at 5:00 PM, and you're kind of allowed to be who you wanna be and you can dress how you wanna dress and you don't feel weird, but at the same time, I was just like, "Why can't this be our government? Why was I just spending three and a half years at a job where this kind of creativity and energy and intelligence isn't fostered or rewarded?" And it kind of bummed me out super, super hard, because the struggle to even hire one amazing, awesome, talented, great designer at the city is so intense, and then to retain that person is even harder.</div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="0:04:40">0:04:40</button><div class="speaker">Andy</div><div class="message-content">When you're competing with dogs and 5:00 PM beers, it's kinda hard to hang. [chuckle]</div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="0:04:44">0:04:44</button><div class="speaker">Chappell</div><div class="message-content">Exactly. And I mean, at the city, the only amenity we had was a water filter. [laughter]</div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="0:04:52">0:04:52</button><div class="speaker">Andy</div><div class="message-content">Cause the water's not clean enough. [laughter] Even though you work at the city, oh no.</div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="0:04:56">0:04:56</button><div class="speaker">Chappell</div><div class="message-content">We work in the City, which is ridiculous, cause shout out, New York City tap water is pretty amazing. That was a real shock for me. And then kind of finally making it into that world of design and designers, and design speak, and design language. I have a background in design, but I've not practiced professionally as a designer. I studied graphic design, and then I went into communications in the design industry. I've been around it, but now I'm actually kind of practicing in it with designers, and now I'm kind of steeping. I'm stewing myself in that world and that language, and it's really blowing my mind.</div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="0:05:41">0:05:41</button><div class="speaker">Matt</div><div class="message-content">Interesting. What part about it specifically is blowing your mind?</div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="0:05:46">0:05:46</button><div class="speaker">Chappell</div><div class="message-content">It's just even though I have been in the design industry and studying it for many, many years, now that I'm actually in it and a part of it, it's like I'm looking from the outside in. And you really start to see the language we've developed around it and how exclusionary it is. And there's just so much assumed knowledge in our industry. For me to kind of step into an agency world, there are words everyday. I'm literally writing down words secretly on a notepad, and I'm going to Google after every meeting. Cause I don't know what these things are. I just spent a week making a PRD, which is apparently I just learned, a Product Requirement Document. This is something that a lot of UX people know and are familiar with. I had no idea.</div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="0:06:34">0:06:34</button><div class="speaker">Andy</div><div class="message-content">Wait. Can you give us the context of your agency? Is it big ad agency? Is it product design? What are the specifics? </div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="0:06:40">0:06:40</button><div class="speaker">Chappell</div><div class="message-content">Oh yeah. No, I mean, I'll tell you, it's not... I don't think it's a secret. I work at a digital agency based out of Brooklyn, called Huge. There's about 500 people in office, but then there's a big international group probably about 1500 people worldwide. And I started there as a...</div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="0:07:00">0:07:00</button><div class="speaker">Andy</div><div class="message-content">That is huge.</div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="0:07:01">0:07:01</button><div class="speaker">Chappell</div><div class="message-content">That is huge. I started as a senior content strategist. Which is its own buzzy, messed up kind of language, that again, I'm like, "What is this? Is this real?" And it is. It's a real job and it's kind of been an industry for seven or eight years, now. But, no one knows what it is or what we do. Even though what we do is really cool and awesome and I love it. But again, I'm really awash in all this new design speak that I thought I knew. You think you know, but you don't know.

[chuckle]</div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="0:08:05">0:08:05</button><div class="speaker">Andy</div><div class="message-content">Well, I'm of such a mixed mind about this stuff because we have a very small operation. So there's eight of us in our office. And we do, I'm assuming, similar type projects to what Huge takes on, but of much, much, much, much, much smaller scale. And it's nice, actually, because we don't know these terms. We don't ever say them to our clients. And our clients don't know these terms either, because they're mostly just people or small companies looking for some kind of website or app that does something. So actually, it's kind of nice that we don't have to have that discourse in our practice cause we just say, "We're gonna build that website and it's gonna do these things. And this is called the e-mail I just sent you." Not a PRD or a BRD or an ABC, or whatever.</div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="0:08:47">0:08:47</button><div class="speaker">Andy</div><div class="message-content">But at the same time, I also recognize how much having a shared language in any kind of community, professional or otherwise, helps to facilitate communication within that community and also real sense of belonging, right? If you have a name for what a PRD is, then it's much easier to talk about than like, "Hey Matt, do you also write a document where you tell the people what you're gonna build for them?" And trying to describe that thing abstractly, if you don't have a word for it. So part of me wants to reject this terminology because it's unnecessary in some contexts, but I also recognize the value of it, which puts me in a weird place.</div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="0:09:23">0:09:23</button><div class="speaker">Robyn</div><div class="message-content">Sure.

You just wanna reject the terms.</div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="0:09:27">0:09:27</button><div class="speaker">Andy</div><div class="message-content">Yeah.</div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="0:09:27">0:09:27</button><div class="speaker">Robyn</div><div class="message-content">That makes sense.</div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="0:09:28">0:09:28</button><div class="speaker">Chappell</div><div class="message-content">It's a weird thing, because I think design by it's nature for me, I'm like, "Yes, this should be the most accessible practice ever." Everything about design should be approachable and understandable, even to a person who knows absolutely zero about this industry. But at the same time, that's not how design makes money and is cool. You make yourself cool and worth money by seeming like you're a pretty big deal. And the way you become a pretty big deal is you develop your own language and you don't really explain it. And you kind of leave people in the dark. And I think that's kind of a bummer.</div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="0:10:09">0:10:09</button><div class="speaker">Robyn</div><div class="message-content">Designers are so dumb.</div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="0:10:11">0:10:11</button><div class="speaker">Matt</div><div class="message-content">Do you think that's real? Do you think the developing the language that people feel is secretive and they have to pay for, is actually what you need to do to run a business? Or do you think it's this myth we've created?</div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="0:10:24">0:10:24</button><div class="speaker">Matt</div><div class="message-content">I've thought that, too. But I also try to practice the opposite. I think. Maybe I'm just bad at running a business, but I think it's okay. I think people appreciate when you just use words that mean what they mean to describe them. Because ultimately, you're just talking to other people and not trying to scare them away.</div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="0:10:43">0:10:43</button><div class="speaker">Robyn</div><div class="message-content">I don't know. I think sometimes it's about masking insecurities, right? I'll talk to senior designers who are mid level designers that are trying to protect their own. They're talking to a junior designer person. They're really hesitant to talk in the same language as that person might understand. Because it's almost like they're trying to protect their place and whatever it is that they're doing. So I feel like sometimes that language is designed to be exclusionary to protect their power.</div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="0:11:11">0:11:11</button><div class="speaker">Matt</div><div class="message-content">Which leads into the idea that it is, the myth of it, is importance. It is indeed a myth. It's not really an actual thing of importance. It's building up these walls to make you feel special.</div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="0:11:22">0:11:22</button><div class="speaker">Andy</div><div class="message-content">That feels true. The thing about people that are maybe more junior in the industry, being more likely to abuse terminology. I think it's partially because if you're studying something, and you learn a new word for something, you're excited to use it. Like, yeah, I know what this means, this is a PRD and that means this and I'm gonna walk around telling people about my PRDs and it's gonna show that I know what I'm doing and I'm on top of stuff. But I also think it's because, as you get more ingrained in that industry and you become a more senior level person, or a more experienced person, you realize that you maybe don't have to use that terminology. And so you skip that and go right to the more human words for the things we're describing.</div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="0:12:00">0:12:00</button><div class="speaker">Andy</div><div class="message-content">But I've definitely observed that, where people that are newer or younger will tend to actually use the terminology more and then it kind of trails off as you are in the industry for a while, I think that's maybe not true if you're in a really, really specialized industry. And I kind of agree with Chappell, our whole job is to communicate so if we [chuckle] can only communicate with ourselves and as soon as someone who doesn't have the same lexicon walks in the room, we are helpless and can't even talk to them anymore, then I think we're failing at our job in a fundamental way. Which is not true if your a rocket designer, or whatever, you're making rocket engines, I bet there's a lot of terminology they need that's very specific, that they do have to use in order to communicate with each other in a functional way. But I feel like our work necessarily has to be more close to the people, more surface level than that, and therefore, any sort of plunging into some highly specialized language is kind of exclusionary, or serves the purpose of making us feel good, not necessarily of advancing the craft.</div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="0:12:53">0:12:53</button><div class="speaker">Chappell</div><div class="message-content">Yeah, I don't even think people realize when they're doing it anymore, is kind of the issue. We don't realize how, just the words we're saying can be excluding groups and there's clearly been many conversations about that and how we can make our language more open and accessible, or at least be more open to the idea that there are other ways of looking at things. For example, I was working with some designers who were writing the copy for a website for a big telecommunications company, and the first screen you would see, as a user asked you, this would be as if you were buying a new cell phone plan, and the first screen would say... Greet you and would say, "How many lines do you need?" [laughter] And so, I just looked at the designers and I was like, "Hey guys, do people know what lines are?" And they were like, "Well, if you're buying a phone, you probably know." And I'm like, "Probably?"</div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="0:14:01">0:14:01</button><div class="speaker">Chappell</div><div class="message-content">I mean, it's not, and this of course is extrapolating a bit, this is about an object and not humans, which are of course the most important thing, but people don't even realize when they're using coded language and they're just moving along. And I'm like, "You know, a lot of people are buying cell phone plans for the first time." Especially young people and who knows, people aren't speaking English as a first language...</div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="0:14:25">0:14:25</button><div class="speaker">Andy</div><div class="message-content">Absolutely.</div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="0:14:25">0:14:25</button><div class="speaker">Chappell</div><div class="message-content">To refer to buying... You go online to buy a phone and the first thing is, "How many lines do you need?" I'd be like "What are... Lines of what?" I wouldn't know what to do at that point.</div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="0:14:36">0:14:36</button><div class="speaker">Andy</div><div class="message-content">I don't want any cocaine, no, no, please! [laughter] Yeah, that's really, that's totally true. I always have this conversation with... I actually have this conversation a lot with interns we have that are doing design work in the office, where I feel like interns and also to a degree, I found engineers tend to describe things like very exactly, when the exact description might not be the description that is actually most understandable. And the thing I always say is, people tend to get defensive about it, be like, "Well, if they're buying a phone well surely they know what a line is, if not than we can't help them." And I always like to... They always portray describing in some other way as catering to the lowest common denominator. Like there's something unsophisticated and below us about trying to communicate with the people that don't know what a line is. And the thing I always describe is it's like a bell curve. You have most of the people who are right in the middle and they're going to give your thing the normal amount of attention, and they have the normal amount of context and understanding about something and maybe the normal person knows what line means.</div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="0:15:36">0:15:36</button><div class="speaker">Andy</div><div class="message-content">Then one extreme have people that are really invested in researching all the cell phone plans imaginable and of course they know what line means and that's the question they probably want to be we asked, because they want to very quickly figure out how their pricing gonna work out and they're deep in this thing. But then you have people that are trailing off on the other side, and this is both people that, like you said, first time phone buyers, people that maybe don't speak English as their first language, people that are just getting their first phone line ever and they don't know what that even means. And that trails off in that direction, and when you're designing that page and choosing that language, you're basically just drawing a line on that bell curve and you're saying, "Nowhere below here do we care about." You're not losing the people on the other side by using more clear and welcoming language and compensating language, you're just cutting off people from the bottom end of that bell curve.</div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="0:16:19">0:16:19</button><div class="speaker">Robyn</div><div class="message-content">Well, don't you think it's also...

Help them out a little bit. You're trying to sell to them [laughter] not the other way around. Not that it's always selling but, it's more about level of effort someone's willing to put in and you can't always assume the max cause, again we're talking about cell phone plans, we're not talking about a video game or something. [laughter]</div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="0:17:02">0:17:02</button><div class="speaker">Andy</div><div class="message-content">A video game is your metric for the thing people are willing to spend the most time on?

Somebody, kind of, yes. [laughter] If somebody's willing to spend their entire life in World of Warcraft, they're very invested in solving puzzles. [laughter] I always feel like the balance is designing a product versus designing a game. A game is like, yeah you can put a puzzle in it and someone is totally willing to solve it because they're invested versus designing an app to get something done, well maybe they'll give you an absolute minimal amount of time and putting a complicated puzzle in the middle of it is the exact opposite of what you wanna do. What I'm saying is that I envy game designers, it seems like a lot of fun. The puzzles and stuff.

[laughter]</div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="0:17:58">0:17:58</button><div class="speaker">Robyn</div><div class="message-content">Yeah, but their stories are a lot harder.</div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="0:18:00">0:18:00</button><div class="speaker">Andy</div><div class="message-content">It's true, and I also feel like I would like designing something like games, in theory, but then in practice I would probably lay awake at night and think, "I'm designing a game, that's my contribution to the earth." Not that what I'm doing now is any more meaningful but, I don't know, I have mixed feelings about it.</div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="0:18:16">0:18:16</button><div class="speaker">Robyn</div><div class="message-content">Yeah, I go through that a lot.</div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="0:18:18">0:18:18</button><div class="speaker">Andy</div><div class="message-content">We're having a similar related conversation in the office right now. We're actually in the midst of just updating our website which has been very simple for a long time. We don't really get work through our website, which is a chicken and egg situation, I don't know if we don't get work through the website because we never spend any time on it or if we are never going to get work through our website therefore we didn't spend any time on it. But our website right now basically just has, here's the people, we'll make anything for you, here's the button to shoot us an e-mail.</div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="0:18:46">0:18:46</button><div class="speaker">Andy</div><div class="message-content">And we're working on changing the way we talk about ourselves, and we're coming across all these same issues that Chappell's describing, right? Where we have industry specific language or certain types of e-commerce sites for the technologies we're using to back these products we're building, for the theoretical practice of what is product design, that's what we kind of call what we do. And people know what that means, do they think it means designing a coat hanger, instead of designing a website? And the thing that I've realized is that, I think we've spent a lot of time thinking that, if we describe ourselves as abstractly as possible... Which is true, we offer a variety of services to all different clients of different sizes and, we'll build pretty much anything we can, that's kind of what we do. So it's not really accurate to say like, "Oh we do this exact one specific thing." But I've had this realization that, if we don't say on the website, anything specific, we just say very vaguely that, "We build websites and apps of all different kinds for all different companies, contact us if you want to talk about it." I think that, that means that nobody that looks at that website is confident that we can do the thing that they maybe need to have done, and if we instead describe...</div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="0:19:52">0:19:52</button><div class="speaker">Chappell</div><div class="message-content">You're just saying you need to be vague as hell.</div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="0:19:56">0:19:56</button><div class="speaker">Andy</div><div class="message-content">Well, I'm saying that's where we are right now.

These are the things that we have a lot of experience at. If we describe those three things, it's not that we'll alienate everybody that doesn't have a problem that fits those three things, it's that we'll actually convince the people that have those three problems to actually contact us and everybody else is in the same place as they were initially, which is not confident that this company can provide the thing that they provided until they e-mail them and ask.</div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="0:20:47">0:20:47</button><div class="speaker">Andy</div><div class="message-content">We're going through all the same questions of, what kind of language do we use to talk about it? Do you use the accurate language? Do we use the language that makes sense to people even though we know that, maybe a technical person would look at it and go it's not quite exactly true but it makes more sense to the average person? How do we handle titles which is something we've always really kinda pushed away because we're a small company, a lot of people do a lot of different things. We don't have discrete project managers, we don't have discrete... Even me I do design work, I do project management work, I do front-end development, I do all kinds of stuff. If you were to write out my title and write all those things out it just seems ridiculous, but at the same time if we don't have that listed on the site then people are kind of curious as to who is doing what. I don't know, it's a lot of questions about...</div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="0:21:32">0:21:32</button><div class="speaker">Andy</div><div class="message-content">What I'm saying is as our company grows and matures, and again we're still very small, eight people, I start to get more and more sympathetic to the kinds of things that Chappell was responding to at Huge, where it's like, "Oh now we have this huge infrastructure and all of these short hands and lingo and acronyms to describe things." Because as you get bigger I start to understand why those distinctions would seem, maybe not important from the outside, or not important from anyone's perspective, actually are important to help divide and separate this big organism that is a company, and actually clearly delineate who's suppose to do what and why and how. Where when you're small you kind of have the luxury of not having to do that, but I see both sides is what it comes down to.</div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="0:22:16">0:22:16</button><div class="speaker">Chappell</div><div class="message-content">Yeah there is part of that divide of having a really small company and a large company, your language changes. It goes from just yelling across the desk, "Hey did you read that thing I sent you?" To, "Hey would you expedite the response to my e-mail about the KPI?" And it turns into this whole thing, this whole other language. And my only fear, aside from excluding people, and not just clients, but excluding people from actually just feeling what we do is approachable for them, I also worry that we're feeding into this weird kind of a scholastic institution money ball situation, where we're just starting new programs to feed these weird titles, and these kind of vague disciplines that... And I say this, and this is funny cause I say this as someone who got a degree in a very vague design discipline, but I also see how that, again, it is creating this weird, insular culture. And when I see a new job title that I've never seen before, I'm like, "Is this some weird response to a program that started out at Cal Arts underground that I don't know about and that charges students $80,000 or whatever?" I don't know, there's something weird and that's my weird capitalist school rant or something. [laughter]</div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="0:24:02">0:24:02</button><div class="speaker">Robyn</div><div class="message-content">It sounds like there's a couple different things between the language that are kind of interesting, right? There's that first one, which is the language that you use on the site and how that's translated to customers. There's a second of the language you use on your site, how that's translated to businesses that wanna potentially hire you. But when it gets down to that title thing, I just... I'm mentoring a student designer right now, and what's interesting is, they were showing me their work and their process yesterday and they were really worried about titles. They were really worried about saying, "I don't know whether I should tell hiring managers I'm a UI designer or a UX designer, or a visual designer versus... " She didn't know what to call herself and I just had to be like, "It doesn't matter." But it does. The entire time I could feel the panic from her just... [chuckle]</div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="0:24:54">0:24:54</button><div class="speaker">Robyn</div><div class="message-content">It was almost like there was this huge bubble and she was trying to figure out how to get herself inside the bubble. But she wanted to figure out what she was supposed to call herself before she told people she wanted to get in the bubble. And I was just like, "It matters, kind of." If a hiring manager is like, "I really need a UI Designer," just call yourself a UI designer, but if you... I don't know. It's this weird thing where it's actually kind of protecting designers who are doing the craft from letting people who also wanna do design, or are doing design on a very new level, get into whatever the clique is.</div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="0:25:28">0:25:28</button><div class="speaker">Chappell</div><div class="message-content">But isn't that also our desperation to kind of keep up with tech culture as well?

The first year at my company I was hired as a UX designer. And it was... That was the work I was doing. This, at the beginning of January, I switched teams and when I switched teams I became an art director instead of a UX designer. But I only switched teams cause I really wanted to work under a particular manager who had a team of art directors. I'm finding myself now where people are like, "Oh, you switched from UX design to an art director role. What was that like?" And I'm like, "Well, I'm doing the same work. I just wanted to work under a different manager so I had to give myself a different title to do that work."</div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="0:31:14">0:31:14</button><div class="speaker">Andy</div><div class="message-content">You mean your art director manager isn't like, "Why do you keep giving me all these UX's, Robyn?

The biggest thing for me, and here's two other trash terms, is the other idea of saying if you work on projects or products. For me, flipping from UX design to art director meant that I stopped doing individual projects and I started looking at overall product vision. It had nothing to do with the way that I was approaching... The way that the output of the work looked like. I didn't say I was an art director and all of a sudden it was all yellow backgrounds with high fashion shots of eggs or something like that. [laughter] I'm still delivering screens and it's still system design, but it's always interesting just to hear people be like, "What a major shift." And I'm like, "No, I'm doing the same work literally.

Okay, so post-Industrial Revolution. We made everything more efficient. We made it so that jobs that humans... It used to take hundreds of humans to do a job, but now it takes one robot that can be maintained by two or three humans. And we've constantly... Then the invention of computers came along and we again, automated tons of work that previously had to be done by fleets and fleets of human beings, now can be done automatically by computers. And all of this has happened and nowhere along the line did we collectively as a society decrease the need for humans to work.</div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="0:34:36">0:34:36</button><div class="speaker">Andy</div><div class="message-content">We just invented all these other jobs to fill in all of this space in between.

And then you have the design programs that pop up. The educational programs that pop up to fill that niche and it's this kind of cyclical thing where no matter what happens, we as humans will constantly create a job for us to have to occupy ourselves. Because we can't possibly handle the idea that we, as a society, have gotten to a place where we could, if we agreed, just diversify the wealth and then most people wouldn't have to work. But we don't accept that, and so instead, we invent all these jobs to keep people in this vicious cycle which...</div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="0:35:27">0:35:27</button><div class="speaker">Chappell</div><div class="message-content">I don't know.</div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="0:35:27">0:35:27</button><div class="speaker">Matt</div><div class="message-content">I agree.

When you just start inventing BS qualifications because it makes you feel cool to say verbal designer instead of copywriter, there's a real cost which is that the industry does get more exclusionary. It does get less diverse because you have less people applying for jobs because you just made up a thing and put it on your job listing because you thought it was cool. It's not a trivial thing. It does actually matter.</div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="0:41:34">0:41:34</button><div class="speaker">Robyn</div><div class="message-content">Right.</div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="0:41:35">0:41:35</button><div class="speaker">Chappell</div><div class="message-content">Yeah.</div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="0:41:35">0:41:35</button><div class="speaker">Matt</div><div class="message-content">Is that the same thing as asking the elephant question, of just these strange barriers that there is no right answer to and you just are hoping you get somebody confident enough they plow through and, "Hey, they showed up here and they ended up here, great."

But the question they're trying to answer is do I want to hang out with you? Sometimes that elephant question is their gateway into figuring if they just wanna hang out with them. Or they just could be a really bad interviewer and they don't know what questions to ask, so they just throw something out to make them seem like they're really important when in reality they're just insecure about what they need or what they want, cause they don't know.</div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="0:42:32">0:42:32</button><div class="speaker">Andy</div><div class="message-content">That's how I evaluate all of my potential friends I ask them where they hide an elephant, if they give me a cool answer, I know we're gonna be friends, otherwise I don't wanna hang out with them cause you don't know where to hide an elephant.</div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="0:42:41">0:42:41</button><div class="speaker">Robyn</div><div class="message-content">Yeah, depending on how you say it, that goes from an interview question to a weird first date question, right?

What's the actionable thing. Is this use of lingo and use of exclusionary terminology that makes people that are new to the industry feel like they have to conform by using the language and makes people that are outside of the industry feel like they're missing some specialized experience. Is this something that should be combated? Should we be in meetings stopping people and saying, "Well when you see MVP we mean minimum viable product and that means this: Blah blah blah blah blah." Should we be explaining those things or is this something that we should continue to use but with a... Sort of a grain of salt, with a sense of awareness of how it might affect people? What do you feel the practical approach to this stuff is? I recognize the problem. I myself find myself writing emails sometimes, where I'm like well... I honestly don't know how to say thing except for this thing except for this term that I know, and I'm going to have to labor over how to say in not six sentences what an MVP is other than just saying MVP and assuming someone knows what that means. What is the practical approach to this? Do you try and avoid these terms in your normal communications with people that may not know them? Or, what do you actually do? </div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="0:44:58">0:44:58</button><div class="speaker">Matt</div><div class="message-content">I wish the acceptable answer was just you're allowed to tease people who use those terms endlessly until they stop using them. But I don't know if that works in every scenario.</div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="0:45:06">0:45:06</button><div class="speaker">Robyn</div><div class="message-content">I don't know. Chappell might answer this differently. For me, it's about the hierarchy in the room. If a VP starts busting out acronyms, I'm gonna Google the acronym and just start talking to it because I want to create trust with them and I want them to know that I know what I'm doing or whatever. But if I am a person that's a little bit more senior in the room and I see somebody throwing it out there, I might just cut the cord and be like, "You can just tell me what you're trying to tell me." It depends on who I'm trying to appease, depending on how I'm going to respond in the moment.</div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="0:45:39">0:45:39</button><div class="speaker">Chappell</div><div class="message-content">Robyn mentioned mentorship earlier, or someone she was mentoring or speaking with, and I agree wholeheartedly with that as a way to kind of combat the exclusionary vibe of this industry. And you know, it's not like you can help everyone all the time, but there might be one person in your office that you can just kind of make sure they know what's happening and don't assume they know anything. And of course don't belittle them or anything but explain things to them very straightforward. Because I think the goodness of our industry is really passed down through, kind of institutional knowledge, that idea. When I worked at the City, working in government, again, has its own language that's incredibly exclusionary.</div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="0:46:33">0:46:33</button><div class="speaker">Chappell</div><div class="message-content">And when I walked in, they don't teach you anything, they don't tell you anything. Apparently, I joined a union and didn't even know I did. There's all of this crazy language that I didn't understand and it was only by the goodness of a fellow city employee, who literally sat down with me for two hours, on their free time, to just go over everything. To teach me the terminology, where I needed to go, how I needed to handle things. And I was so thankful for that. And that's kind of... It's kind of the same thing in the design industry. If I have juniors under me, I just sit down with them and I go over presentations with them and I'm like, "Ask me questions. There's no dumb question. Just ask me anything."</div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="0:47:17">0:47:17</button><div class="speaker">Robyn</div><div class="message-content">Sure.</div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="0:47:17">0:47:17</button><div class="speaker">Andy</div><div class="message-content">Yeah, the only time I've ever felt good about asking those questions is once I felt I got to a level where anything I don't know is probably reasonable that I don't know them and then it's okay to ask questions. Whereas when I just started, it was like, "Oh I can't ask anybody any question because then I'll just look stupid." But now I feel like my attitude is just, if I don't know about it it's fine, I'm just going to ask what it means and someone will explain it to me and they won't think I'm stupid, I hope. But If I had to go back in time, and just be a younger version of me, I don't know how I would have changed that and would I just adopt the exact same attitude and it's fine? Or would I just have to live through it and wouldn't it be nicer if someone just explained that to me? </div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="0:47:57">0:47:57</button><div class="speaker">Chappell</div><div class="message-content">You sometimes just have to...

And also just like... I used to just get really angry when I found out what something meant, like a word I didn't understand, cause I would get angry when I found out how bullshitty it was. Like agile. That is some hardcore craziness. Cause, I know there's a whole process and a whole thing and I respect that, but the name, people make it sound like it's this magic thing when I'm like, "Oh.

When we were going through critical design, that was every portfolio and I was like, you know what's crazy is that Yale has just created this... Or Metahaven and the Netherlands has created this visual language that Yale has now codified in their system and they've created a whole generation of designers who have codified it. And then, they're gonna only judge design based on that visual language. And so, anything that falls out of that parameter for them, it doesn't look good or doesn't seem right. Someone who's maybe from, I don't know, a designer in North Africa who doesn't have that visual language is gonna fall outside of their parameter. They might not consider hiring them.</div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="0:54:01">0:54:01</button><div class="speaker">Chappell</div><div class="message-content">This is where I'm like, design is not only dealing with the language that we surround the culture with.

I know a lot of people that teach there part-time and full-time, and from talking to both interns we've had over the years and to instructors, and I also am fairly close with the chair of the department, this stuff is actually... It's not top-down. One year, all of a sudden, people were like, "Students are doing everything squiggly, and I don't know why but everything's squiggly now, and I'm not sure what to do about it." [laughter]</div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="0:54:39">0:54:39</button><div class="speaker">Andy</div><div class="message-content">A lot of these things are permeating in the culture, and then the professors end up being like, "Well, I didn't learn this, but I guess this is what we're doing now, so I gotta figure out how to speak to this and catch up on what the zeitgeist happens to be at this moment." But it's very real that those things breed and then all of a sudden, that's what everything is. I go to the commencement show every year at MICA, and watching the design work change so dramatically year over year, and now I talk to part-time interns we have, and I'm like, "Yeah, when I was a design student, nobody did anything that wasn't super corporate looking and very clean and graphic design with a capital G and a capital D." And now you go and it's like somebody took Times New Roman and made it neon and then put it through a random transformation and route processing and then printed it on a poster, and you're like, "This is cool. This has changed so much in the six or seven years since I've graduated, but it's totally different."</div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="0:55:35">0:55:35</button><div class="speaker">Robyn</div><div class="message-content">Man.

I wanna briefly go down... And I'll go first so you all have time to think about it. I want to go down just the terms and the lingo that we find ourselves using or that we actually prefer in spite of all of our strong feelings about how this stuff can be kind of exclusionary. Is there still some terms that I find myself really having to force myself to stop using? Some of them, I'm not going to say UX, UI, visual design, none of that stuff. But for me, the things that I always end up saying... I keep coming back to MVP, minimum viable product, which is a thing that when I first read about it, which was right around the time I was graduating, when the Y Combinator startup culture was just becoming a well-known, well-renowned thing, that resonated so strongly with me. And it's just like agile, right? All you're saying is, "We're gonna build the version of it first that makes the least assumptions, and then we're going to use any new information to effect how we build it in the future." It's a very obvious thing, but short-handing that has been very useful for me, and I found myself wanting to say that to many potential clients or people and ending up actually explaining what that is in two or three sentences, but I have to spend two or three sentences doing it instead of just saying MVP.</div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="0:57:11">0:57:11</button><div class="speaker">Andy</div><div class="message-content">I wish I could use that one and trust that people would know what it means. The other one... I keep coming back to that I always want to say, even though I know it has no meaning to anybody outside of the industry, is design sprint. Which is basically to say, "You don't really know what you want yet. You have an idea, but in order for us to give you a proposal to build that idea, we have to flesh out some of these details, and that's gonna require us to spend a week to two weeks doing some preliminary design work and show you that so you can then look at something and give us feedback because it's so much easier to get feedback on something once you're looking at it. It's so much more difficult to just imagine in your head what it might be and conjure the perfect description of the work you need." And describing that is always cumbersome. I wish I could just say, design sprint, and everyone knew exactly what that meant, but I can't. I have to be like, "Well, you don't know what you want yet. We can't give you an estimate for this idea giving how vague it is. We have to work with you and design this thing for this amount of time." I have to explain the whole thing every single time.</div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="0:58:06">0:58:06</button><div class="speaker">Andy</div><div class="message-content">Those are the two that I want to be able to say those things, but I know I just can't, and I always have to correct myself whenever I go to just type, "We're gonna design sprint this for you so that we can make an MVP in two weeks."

A question on your design sprint thing. Why don't you just take them in for an hour long design thinking exercise where you work out Post It notes of what they're looking for?</div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="0:58:37">0:58:37</button><div class="speaker">Matt</div><div class="message-content">So yours is design thinking, Robyn?</div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="0:58:39">0:58:39</button><div class="speaker">Robyn</div><div class="message-content">Whatever you call it. A design sprint or whatever it is. If they don't know what they're trying to solve, why don't you just put them in a room and ask them a bunch of questions on Post-It notes and tell them to write it all down, and then they put all their Post-It notes on a whiteboard, and you pluck away what it is and what it isn't? As opposed to spending two weeks designing something in the dark and be like, "Is this what it is?"</div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="0:58:58">0:58:58</button><div class="speaker">Andy</div><div class="message-content">It's a good question. The first answer is that a lot of these are people that haven't... Aren't clients yet, these are potential clients, and we have to propose to do something they're gonna pay us for. And we could propose to have them sit in a room for an hour and a half, let's write some things down, and maybe they'll give us enough information to make an actual proposal for a project. But in reality, we oftentimes... Someone says, "I have an idea for a dog walking app that's like Uber." And it's like, "Okay. Well, what does that actually mean?" And they're like, "I don't know. I just had a brilliant idea for Uber for dog walking." And then we have to work through what that is.</div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="0:59:32">0:59:32</button><div class="speaker">Andy</div><div class="message-content">Also, I really do think that a lot of people don't respond well or can't actually express their idea through the Post-It notes, wireframes... Feature document, right? The description of what the product needs to do, that document, for a certain group of people is exactly what they need. When you give that document to a group of engineers or to people that are designers with that kind of background, that means everything it needs to mean, but when you give it to somebody that is outside of those worlds, oftentimes there are things that they may think are givens or obvious that aren't listed, they don't ever bring up or they may just forget to mention a very important thing. We've found constantly if we put an image in front of somebody, they can say, "This is great, but where is X?" And we're like, "Oh, you literally never said anything about X. That's not a thing that just happens, we need to build X."</div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="1:00:21">1:00:21</button><div class="speaker">Andy</div><div class="message-content">We found that, that's actually a much easy way for most of our clients to actually respond to things. Is that we use the visuals as a means of communication as opposed to designing perfect screens and then, building them pixel for pixel or whatever. Yeah, usually it's a week, it depends on the project. But those are the two things, those terms I keep coming back to are things that... They mean so much to me and that meaning is actually genuine. It's a short-hand for an actually meaningful thing. It's not just a different synonym for a word that I could just say. There's actually some embedded meaning there that makes those terms valuable, but I also recognize that I shouldn't just say them willy nilly to people, I have to explain what they mean.</div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="1:00:58">1:00:58</button><div class="speaker">Robyn</div><div class="message-content">For sure.</div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="1:00:58">1:00:58</button><div class="speaker">Andy</div><div class="message-content">Does that... Do other people have words like that, that mean things to them or that they find themselves using in spite of themselves? </div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="1:01:05">1:01:05</button><div class="speaker">Matt</div><div class="message-content">Well I know I always say, every person is a user, everything we ever make is a product and every short meeting is a stand-up. And I feel when I exam those I'm like, "Oh, I'm just talking about people, talking about projects, talking about meetings. Don't know why I use these terms." But I feel like there's... I probably have an endless number of those that... I'm basically almost using synonyms that... Why am I using synonyms? I'm not totally sure. Cause that's what everybody else says.</div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="1:01:29">1:01:29</button><div class="speaker">Andy</div><div class="message-content">In-culturation.</div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="1:01:31">1:01:31</button><div class="speaker">Chappell</div><div class="message-content">Yeah, I love it in a weird way and hate myself, but I will straight up...

High level scoping. It's weird because I've only been in this environment for a few months now and it's already... They say, if you just drop yourself into a foreign country, you'll know the language in a couple months, it's totally true. Which I say that to anyone who is kind of freaked out of starting new jobs, or jumping into these cultures, you can pick up the language and just start using it and all the sudden people don't question you when you just use it with authority. But I don't know. I still cringe at words like deliverables and assets and anything that just means, "Here is the work I made for you." And... But I'm also kind of like an old person I refer to all Apple products as Macintosh's, still. And I still talk about...</div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="1:02:48">1:02:48</button><div class="speaker">Andy</div><div class="message-content">Nice Macintosh phone.</div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="1:02:49">1:02:49</button><div class="speaker">Chappell</div><div class="message-content">A nice Macintosh phone.</div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="1:02:52">1:02:52</button><div class="speaker">Matt</div><div class="message-content">Do you use that to get on the Facebook?

That could be a title for this episode. We maybe have that already. Robyn, you wanna get in the last word? Do you have any final thoughts on this topic? I feel like we've all gotten something in, but what are your last thoughts? </div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="1:04:14">1:04:14</button><div class="speaker">Robyn</div><div class="message-content">Yeah, sure. I kinda mentioned this a little bit earlier but this idea of depending on who you're talking to, like depends on the language that you shift to. And that just comes down to the idea of... If I'm talking to somebody and I can see that they want a specific thing and I think I can provide that thing but I needed to talk about it in their language to give them that. I'll manipulate that moment and just start speaking in their language, and that's fine because I can just rush off and figure out what they were saying after the conversation.</div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="1:04:44">1:04:44</button><div class="speaker">Robyn</div><div class="message-content">But if I'm not in the position of needing something from that person and I'm in a position where somebody wants something from me, then I have a little bit more control to just change how that conversation rolls. I could figure out where I push myself in the conversation to being a little bit more accessible versus if I'm talking to somebody who is in a position of power that I listen to what they say and then take it and digest it and then flip it into an actual accessible language. It depends on the moment, depends on the person, depends on what I need out of the moment. Just your miles may vary. That and my second point that I always tell people is to just listen to Navasurf. That's all I have.</div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="1:05:32">1:05:32</button><div class="speaker">Andy</div><div class="message-content">There you go. Yeah. I will say, if you have the privilege to, something I've been trying to get better about, is just if I don't know some terminology, either because I think the person I'm talking to is much smarter than me or because I think the person I'm talking to is BSing me, I will just ask them to explain it. I will not sit there and Google it and pretend like I'm supposed to know this thing. I'll be like, "I'm sorry, can I stop you for a moment? What do you mean when you say free cycles? Can you just explain that?" The result is either, you learn something valuable because this is actually a term with true meaning that needs to be short-handed in some way because it's got depth and purpose, or you make somebody explain the dumb word that means nothing. And both of those situations are a big win for you because watching somebody explain that, "Oh, cycles just means that you have some time to work on it." And you're like, "Okay, great, wanted to make sure I knew what you were talking about." That's a win.</div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="1:06:22">1:06:22</button><div class="speaker">Matt</div><div class="message-content">I did shame a coworker the other day for saying free cycles. It really worked. I think I'm not gonna have to hear that anymore.</div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="1:06:26">1:06:26</button><div class="speaker">Andy</div><div class="message-content">Yeah. All you have to do is ask.</div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="1:06:27">1:06:27</button><div class="speaker">Robyn</div><div class="message-content">What the hell is free cycles?</div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="1:06:28">1:06:28</button><div class="speaker">Chappell</div><div class="message-content">Tell us what that means? I have no idea.</div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="1:06:30">1:06:30</button><div class="speaker">Andy</div><div class="message-content">Oh, that's a thing people say... We get contacted all the time. We get an e-mail and be like, "Hey, we need some movie development. Do you have any free cycles coming up?" And what that means is do you have weeks or some other unit.</div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="1:06:42">1:06:42</button><div class="speaker">Matt</div><div class="message-content">Do you have any availability? Do you have free time?</div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="1:06:44">1:06:44</button><div class="speaker">Andy</div><div class="message-content">Yeah. It just means do you have time to work on this project and people say cycles instead and it's like, "Okay, cool, don't know what that means." If you have the privilege and you're not worried about losing your job or something, ask people what the words mean. That's a fun game to play.</div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="1:06:56">1:06:56</button><div class="speaker">Chappell</div><div class="message-content">In most cases there are very few times that asking what something means will get you in trouble, especially if you're a new person. But if you just as a thought experiment, if you take a day and promise yourself to not assume anything and when people say something and you don't know what it means, just ask them. You will be shocked at the end of your day how much you learned and recognize that's all stuff I would have just walked by and ignored because I just was gonna pretend I knew what it was.</div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="1:07:33">1:07:33</button><div class="speaker">Chappell</div><div class="message-content">And you have... How many times do you mention a movie and your friend is like, "Oh!" And they nod about it and you're kind of like, "Yeah, they haven't seen it." You know? And it's really interesting because they have the choice to either say, "I've never seen that, what's it about?" You have an every opportunity when someone says something if you haven't heard of it to say, "Hey, what is that?" And that's for me the most exciting thing when someone doesn't know a movie I've seen or a word I'm using, I get super excited that I get to tell them about that. There's also this idea of taking joy in just explaining something. It's really, really lovely. When someone hasn't heard of a band that you love that is the best moment to be like, "Pull up a chair, kid." You know?</div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="1:08:26">1:08:26</button><div class="speaker">Robyn</div><div class="message-content">Well, that moment is an interesting one too. Cause I feel like... I think it was Leah Reich or something like that was talking to me about, was it Cat Stevens or something like that of this band that if somebody's like, "Oh, do you listen to whatever the band is?" And then they're like, "No." And then they take like a half hour to talk to about that thing or whatever it is. [laughter] Don't be that person, just give him your 30 second highlight on why that thing is dope. And then maybe text them a link.</div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="1:08:57">1:08:57</button><div class="speaker">Chappell</div><div class="message-content">Yeah. That's good.</div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="1:08:58">1:08:58</button><div class="speaker">Andy</div><div class="message-content">I will say being really excited to explain why a thing you like is great is exactly what your cocky male friend would do. You've come full circle. They'd be very excited about explaining that too.</div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="1:09:09">1:09:09</button><div class="speaker">Robyn</div><div class="message-content">It's gonna crush me that I can't remember the band, that it was happening with her.</div></div><div class="transcript-message"><button class="seek-button" data-timestamp="1:09:14">1:09:14</button><div class="speaker">Andy</div><div class="message-content">I don't know.

We have a functional CMS now as before we were just like hard-copying, hard-coding in providers and stuff. We re-did that and that's really exciting.
