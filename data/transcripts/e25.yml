    content: "I have this plan. I'm not gonna go in too much detail here partially because it's somewhat secret plan, and partially because it's not what the podcast is about, but this year I'm planning to cook a miniaturized Thanksgiving for the Thanksgiving meal that I'm hosting where everything is a smaller version of itself. It's going to be very cute and very adorable and I will go no further into it now, except to say that I had to acquire miniature wine bottles and some places make individual servings of wine that come in like something that appears to be a miniature wine bottle which is perfect for my needs, except I wanted to serve some nice wine with dinner and they don't make nice wine in these little single serving bottles. You may be surprised to find out. So, I got this stuff which is some really cheap, like sweet, a little bit fizzy, red wine that I'm drinking out of this bottle so I can empty them out and then later fill them with better wine, but I don't have it in me to pour wine down the drain no matter how cheap because guilt."

Nightmare scenario. Anyway, it's just you and I Matt this week because this is gonna be the second to last episode of Working File for a little while. We're not having some dramatic finale. The show is not necessarily over but we kind of started this show almost exactly a year ago, well, actually truth be told, far more than a year ago if you count the episodes we recorded ahead of time..."

    speaker: "Andy"
    content: "'Cause it's hard to plan. Dang it. We tricked you all into thinking this was way easier to do. [chuckle]"
  -
    timestamp: "04:04"
    speaker: "Andy"
    content: "Yeah, actually the very, very first episode of Working File recorded was I think released as episode four or five and it was episode with Jen and Satchel and we recorded that almost a year and half, two years ago. That was recorded in February or March of 2015. So that was when we started working on the show and it took us a little while to figure out exactly how it was gonna work, and to line up contributors, and to figure out a name, and to do all the stuff you have to do to make a podcast. And we did all that and recorded some other episodes, so we had a little bit of a backlog to make sure we could stay on top of it. But yeah it was about a year ago, two weeks from when this episode is released that the podcast came out and it was a bit of an experiment when we started it, right Matt? "
  -
    timestamp: "04:46"
    speaker: "Matt"
    content: "Yeah. I think the idea that we would be able to do a panel show with a group of people every... We said every two weeks because of scheduling. We still... I didn't have to schedule it so maybe I shouldn't speak to it but it seemed like a monumental task. [chuckle] It's a lot of getting people in the same place during their free time which is not always the easiest."
  -
    timestamp: "05:05"
    speaker: "Andy"
    content: "Yeah. And the podcast is a small operation right now. We don't have any financial support of any kind. We do have XYZ Type sponsoring the transcripts, which is great so we don't have to pay for that out of pocket. But the rest of our expenses are out of pocket and we can't pay our contributors right now and I think asking anybody especially the amazing, talented, professionals that we've had on this show over the past year to take time out of their schedule for no money and no real benefit to themselves whatsoever to record a show with us is a big ask."
  -
    timestamp: "05:35"
    speaker: "Andy"
    content: "And yeah, I think we kind of started the show, trying to see if that was something we could sustain. I know that I was kind of inspired by other rotating panel shows. The one that is the most, kind of close example to what I was imagining this show might be is The Incomparable, which is a show all about culture and geek stuff, movies, film, television. But they have a rotating cast of people and sometimes they have seven, eight plus people on an episode. And they have a great rapport they're able to maintain, even though the exact cast is always rotating and they record and release regularly. That's what we were going for. And yeah, it's proven to be difficult, and yeah so for the time being, we are going to put a pause on things at least, and either figure out a way to do this more sustainably or figure out a change so Working File can be something different, or maybe this just stays a self-contained, one year, 26 episode season, kind of up in the air at this point."
  -
    timestamp: "06:34"
    speaker: "Matt"
    content: "Yeah, and I think the way I see it is like if it continues, it was a nice season one, and maybe we pick it back up in a few months because we either recorded a backlog or found a way to keep a more sustainable group panel. And also come up with some topic ideas that are fresh and exciting for us so we're not rehashing the same old thing. And if it doesn't happen, then it's a self-contained thing, and that's okay too. Some of my favorite podcasts are six episodes, and they never had more and sometimes I go back and re-listen to them. So hopefully we were making something that was somewhat evergreen too."

I think some of these listeners are probably people that have followed you and I, Matt, for five years now, in all of our various podcasting adventures. To those people I would say double thank you. Also..."

    timestamp: "08:03"
    speaker: "Andy"
    content: "Yeah, I would say that we're not done making podcasts, certainly, so we gotta figure out what the next thing is and how that works. But, yeah, we felt we owed you a little bit of transparency, dear listener, whom we adore, and that's the deal."
  -
    timestamp: "08:18"
    speaker: "Matt"
    content: "Yeah, and I do hope too that we can find a way to do an exciting podcast relating to the things that we work on or our life experience that stays fresh. 'Cause I do know there's part of me that's like, \"I can't talk about the same design stuff over and over again.\" And my life is changing, it's different than when I started being a designer, when On The Grid started and we started talking about very different things. So I always have the desire to keep talking about my life, and I hope we can do that in a way that stays interesting."
  -
    timestamp: "08:52"
    speaker: "Andy"
    content: "Yeah, for me, I think the appeal of a show about design, back in the day when we started On The Grid, five plus years ago now, the appeal of that, to me, was that I was really interested in talking about that stuff and I was still relatively new, as in terms of a working professional designer, and trying to find my way. And so I've always been a person that works through things out loud, talking through something is the best way for me to figure it out for myself, in the first place. And I think the beautiful thing about making a podcast is we found that some of the people like to be part of that as well and hear that out loud, working through of ideas. But yeah, for lack of a better word, I feel like I've settled into a place in my career where, it's not that I'm stagnating and not learning new things, it's just that the way we talk about things just gets a little more boring. And like you said Matt, we're talking about similar things repeatedly, which I think can be valuable for a listener, especially 'cause when you consider not everyone listens to every episode, I don't think that covering the same topic is inherently bad, but does make the experience of recording it different. And sometimes it's harder for the show to grow with us."
  -
    timestamp: "10:00"
    speaker: "Andy"
    content: "So yeah, now my feeling about it is that I almost feel like the reason we're talking about design is because it's one of the only things that, not only do we know a lot about and feel like we have something worthwhile to say, but also we know people in the industry that also are smart and know what they're talking about and have things to say. And so in that sense it's like the topic is the topic because it's the thing we know, but the underlying desire is to make something and work in this medium, and this was the latest result of that particular impulse."
  -
    timestamp: "10:37"
    speaker: "Matt"
    content: "Yeah, and I think I second your working through something, the thing that's most exciting to me is talking about things that are unknown and new ideas and things I'm not so expert at."
  -
    timestamp: "10:47"
    speaker: "Andy"
    content: "But now you know it all Matt, you're a pro, you know all the graphic design."
  -
    timestamp: "10:49"
    speaker: "Matt"
    content: "Well, I was gonna say, there's things that are very much, still very exciting to me, and exciting to talk about, but they're probably not the same things that fueled On The Grid or maybe even the very beginning of this show."
  -
    timestamp: "11:04"
    speaker: "Andy"
    content: "Yeah. And now you're in a very similar position that I've been in for a little while, where running your own company or being a part of running a company, not only does some of the things at the forefront of our minds become less relevant to a bigger audience, like some of the things we worry about, most people don't already think about it, don't care about, which just makes a podcast about it that much more narrow and boring to most people. But also, there's some things you can't really work through out loud the way you'd like to. It's easier when you're working though like, gosh, flat design versus iOS 6 and gradients, what's the thing gonna be? That was a conversation that... There's no problem having that conversation as publicly as you want, but when you're talking about some of the things we have to deal with, no, it's just not the same kind of thing, it's not a public conversation in the same way. It's things that happen in more small circles."
  -
    timestamp: "11:56"
    speaker: "Andy"
    content: "Yeah, and just, publicly, a big thank you to every contributor that took time out of their schedule and rolled the dice by recording an episode with us. They didn't necessarily know what it would involve and their first time recording something themselves and making all that work out. People jump through a lot of hoops. There was a lot of episodes of this show that I am very very proud of and expect to be for a while which is not something that can be said of all of our podcast projects. They don't all age that well but I think a lot of these episodes are great and I'm very happy that they will live online, obviously the websites going nowhere, feed's going nowhere, these episodes aren't gonna be hidden from anybody ever, well I shouldn't ever but, heat-death of the universe etc etc, they'll be online for a long time."

    content: "Well probably I would assume SoundCloud's gonna die before the universe but who knows. Chance did buy it I don't know."
  -
    timestamp: "12:43"
    speaker: "Andy"
    content: "Yeah Chance will save it. [laughter] But yeah, there's a lot of shows I'm really... A lot of these episodes are things I'm really proud of and I'm glad that they can live online with the transcripts courtesy of XYZ Type. And yeah this all wouldn't have been possible without the collaboration from a bunch of relative strangers so thanks to everybody that gave it a shot."

    content: "Yeah, and what's this trendy responsive design right?"
  -
    timestamp: "13:27"
    speaker: "Andy"
    content: "[chuckle] Exactly. No so the thing I wanna talk about tonight is I've got two main projects that are at least somewhat on my plate at work, other people are working on it as well but the two things that I'm contributing to right now design-wise, are kind of like on the opposite ends of the spectrum. We've talked about it before and I just wanna revisit 'cause it keeps coming back in my work is popping up as a thing that I think is worth mentioning which is that, one of the projects is a new product that it doesn't exist yet and we are involved in the entire vision and design process of deciding what the feature set is and how the whole thing works and what the different users and roles and permissions are and how the whole system is connected to itself and how everything works functionally on a functional level with mercifully a very very very clear audience and a very clear goal which I think we've talked about before Matt it's one of the things I value most in any kind of design project. When someone can very clearly articulate here's who this is for and here's what's gotta do, I feel like I have the best chance of doing my job properly."
  -
    timestamp: "14:34"
    speaker: "Andy"
    content: "So that's one of the projects, the other project we're working on is, it's also for a new thing which I guess is a similarity. But it's a thing that is not functional, we're basically making a marketing website for a thing that will be announced at some point in the future, and this website has no real functionality beyond contact forum, it's just basically got to get people aware and excited about the thing in question. And I don't mean to be cryptic it doesn't really matter but it's not important to the story, it's just... Pretend it's a new product or an event or whatever you wanna pretend it is."
  -
    timestamp: "15:11"
    speaker: "Matt"
    content: "Yeah, we're familiar with this dichotomy, it's an app and a landing page. Right?"
  -
    timestamp: "15:17"
    speaker: "Andy"
    content: "Sure and I feel like more and more as my career has gone along and it's starting to really stark contrast this particular week and the past couple weeks I've had these two projects kind of simultaneously on my plate moving between them just feels like total temperature shock. It's like you're going from one thing to another thing and it's like a whole different job and a whole different way of thinking. In one place we have this goal and we get to make decisions about that goal and the decisions we make we get to decide here's why we think this is the way we wanna go with this and here's the context behind it, here's our underpinnings for these design decisions and the other side it's like, \"Well is this cool? Is this gonna make people excited about this thing?\" It's all of these much more gray ambiguous metrics that are much harder to say like, \"Here's a good reason why this will get people excited about this thing.\" Or \"Here's a good reason why this will communicate the thing we need to communicate about this particular project.\""
  -
    timestamp: "16:12"
    speaker: "Andy"
    content: "And I don't know, it's just been striking me that like it's both of these... This is like the two ends of the spectrum of what I consider to be my skill set, I don't think one is something I'm capable of and one is not something I'm capable of but it does almost feel sometimes like they are really two separate jobs in the way that like being a teacher and and being a plumber are two separate jobs. The end result is similar like, \"I made a thing, I drew a picture of a website in a drawing program\", that's the result but the whole process and the underpinnings and the thinking to get you there is like just a universe apart."
  -
    timestamp: "16:48"
    speaker: "Matt"
    content: "Yeah. The second one, the marketing site where you have to get people hyped about a product, the landing page one how do you approach that? 'Cause I can wrap my brain around... I can wrap my brain around your brain in the functional app, but I don't know if I've experienced you in marketing world. What is your take when somebody has an opinion and you know it's subjective they know it's subjective and a decision has to be made?"
  -
    timestamp: "17:16"
    speaker: "Andy"
    content: "Well, it's a similar process in some ways, I still wanna understand the audience as much as I can, and this particular thing that we are essentially marketing, has a couple different audiences and these audiences care about it in different ways. Somebody's going to be effectively the consumer of it, somebody is going to be aware of it but is not going to consume it but has other questions they need answered about it, and there's other people that are affected by it that will neither consume it nor will they actually care about it. There are discreet audiences and we do understand those audiences pretty clearly, it's just at the end of the day our job in this scenario is really just playing translator between the people that are making this thing, who have a vision and who have an idea of what they want it to be, and maybe lack the skills or time or whatever to manifest that vision to the outside world such that other people can understand it. We're kinda just playing translator there to be like, \"Alright, I need to understand you client very very intimately so that I can express the thing that you would like to express outwardly and do my job making something other people can see that will communicate those things that you have deep inside you that often times... \""
  -
    timestamp: "18:23"
    speaker: "Andy"
    content: "And to no fault of a client. This is something that I think people learn early in their career is that no client is gonna make this easy on you because it's not their job, they don't know how to communicate outwardly so if you just kinda go to them and say, \"Yes please, give us all the exact perfect messaging and we'll just pick a nice font for it and make it look pretty.\" That's not gonna work because they didn't hire you to pick a nice font, that's not what your job is. So we're trying to play this translating role and it's definitely a lot harder. I still like to... I've realized that it taps into a whole different part of my brain. The me that you know that talks on this show mostly that talks about design mostly, mostly functional design is somebody that likes things to be very regimented, logical, and you have reasons for things and everything's explained. There's a whole sort of rigorous process to go through to get there."
  -
    timestamp: "19:19"
    speaker: "Andy"

I don't know to me it's just like a whole different part of my brain where it's like you have to tap into these grey areas where compared to the other design project, the project where here's a very clear audience that has a practical problem and we we're gonna functionally solve it with software, it feels comparatively arbitrary sometimes where it's like, \"Ah this feels right, but why these colors? Why this shape?\" \"I don't know, it feels kind of right and it kind of reminds us of this thing\" is not the most satisfying explanations for decisions when you're used to the other kind of design."

I guess I always think of it as marketing versus making a functional app. I don't think that's like a totally... What would you say? Like a real dichotomy but obviously there's bits in both but it feels like sometimes you're doing just one or the other. The marketing side of things, I think there are ways to get to a end result quickly but it's mostly like repeating tricks or looking at something else and just dissecting why it is the way it is and then just doing that again. Something simple like \"Hey, what makes it luxury?\" \"Well, we're gonna make the font really small, maybe we'll make it uppercase and track it out.\" And that's what other people do and so people are used to seeing that and they think luxury. It's just like if you wanna do something unique it gets really challenging because you tend to not really have a justification, the client doesn't really have a justification and usually what happens is people aren't brave enough to just go for it and be like, \"I've never seen this before.\" Or you're not really as unique as you think you are."

A kitchen's a bad example, designing just a nice house, a vacation house where you're using the same skills but the considerations when you're designing an airport are so vastly different than the considerations when you're designing a house for somebody.

Which is not true of something like an airport where the goal is, \"No listen, here's the deal. We would like people to think Charlotte is cool while they're here. Maybe hang an old airplane from the ceiling but we're gonna move thousands of people through every single day, and the every 10% you add to everyone's walk is going to slow down every single little operation in this entire building.\" It's just it's a very functional problem to me, it seems.

I just have some clients that just pretty much only come to me for the marketing side of things and then some clients are just very specifically doing iterations on an app and this app has all...

I actually really like it, I really like that process because you just... It just feels like you're chiseling away at something until it's perfect. But there are certainly times when you're like, \"I know that's the conclusion with this small amount of data but I think the reason is X.\" \"I think it's because there was too much of this and not enough of that and we didn't measure it.

David's just out here helping out other Davids apparently. He talks in the first couple of chapters about how we define knowledge, how do you know you know something, how can you actually demonstrate you know something? And he gives this really relevant example about how simply observing something and extrapolating that the thing you have observed repeatedly will continue is kind of a dangerous logic and doesn't really represent knowledge. An example he gives is that in totally the early days of humanity before we had any semblance of science or real civilization, people could probably predict the sun would come up the next day 'cause they've been alive for however many number of years and everyday the sun's come up and so they come to the conclusion that the sun comes out very single day, that's knowledge."

So to me I feel like a lot of the metric stuff falls in that fist category of like, \"Well, we know that this increases sales,\" and it's like okay, that is a thing that you know but it doesn't really... \" The way in which you're trying to apply it doesn't really make a lot of sense."

So yeah that's my feeling about all that. I feel like it's kind of a necessary... We're necessarily ignorant at this point still because we don't have a way to describe these behaviours more rigorously. At least that is in keeping with our processes. Maybe behavioral scientists like the ones that Facebook and Google employ are the ones that are actually... Psychiatrists are in there figuring this stuff out and actually coming up with good explanations for why these things happen but most of us are just going, \"Hey look, more T-shirt sales when the button is bigger, make button bigger bigger bigger.\""

And it's this relatively obvious thing now that you know it in hindsight. There's no other explanation for the movement of these shapes in the sky over time if you just observe them and think about it. But it took so long to arrive at that very clean truth that the idea of us arriving at some truth about the behavior of people, this big messy mass of organic material and electric signals firing at people's brains and muscle fibers.

And vice versa, you don't want one employee's time to be too dedicated to an individual client. But also that is the most efficient, for sure. It's way better to do that, in terms of efficiency than it is to have everything peer reviewed six times and make sure that there are multiple people in all of the decision making positions to follow something through.

There's gonna be somebody else pitching their project that says it cost X and they have not learned this lesson yet. [chuckle] And they're gonna learn it the hard way. [laughter] They're gonna learn it the hard way probably by just... Hopefully if they're above board they're gonna learn that the lesson the hard way by eating a bunch of time themselves and kinda getting burned to the project.

    content: "Yeah. So that's the kind of place where there's like... Maybe it just doesn't work and it's a fool's errand but I do think there's a place where we can take what we've known. It's not like we've never done them before, we've done scope projects before and our... We've learned it tends to go a little bit over. But if you were happy to take on the project then, eat a little bit of time. But you got to put more people on. You got to control the process or... I feel like the other... You're talking about the dichotomy between the marketing and the functional app. I feel like there's the dichotomy between being in full control of the process and saying exactly what the scope of it is. First, it's you're selling your time, where... If you just sell your time, it's really easy, you just work and then say, here's how long it took and then they pay you that amount of money and you never have to plan anything. But you're not in control of your time."

    timestamp: "43:46"
    speaker: "Matt"
    content: "There is this kind of like, \"grass is greener\" thing where it seems like maybe if we can get really good at defining everything up front and then sticking to our plan and knowing that no matter what you do, there's gonna be unknown so just factor in that there's gonna be unknowns. Just like pad it a little bit or add some time for like, \"Here's the thing we're probably gonna have to tackle, we just don't know what it is yet 'cause no matter what that comes up.\" Maybe that leads to a better process because you get to define everything up front. The thing we have figured out or figured out a long time ago is that just do it in two phases. Design it all first. Make sure they're happy with everything and then scope it all out and figure out what the development time is gonna be because when you try to do both of those at the same time, you're kinda restricted as the designer where you're like, \"Well, I could make this decision but we already said it costs X and you don't wanna change that so just no can't do it\". Which doesn't feel great."

    timestamp: "44:48"
    speaker: "Andy"
    content: "Yeah. It's funny because you and I Matt for years, spent time talking about how we strive to do the opposite of that in some ways, right? Like this idea of a beautiful, symbiosis between design and development where everything was kind of fluid and you didn't have this manufactured deadline of we must decide what everything will be before this date. This is the date we design the entire thing and you approved it. And then from there, nothing may change and we're just going to build it as spec'd. And I don't know. In some ways, you and I are just going down the same road of learning the lessons that every other company that has done anything in history has learned and which caused them to arrive at that waterfall model of like, \"Well, we're gonna talk to you and we're gonna make a specs document then we're gonna make a wireframes then we're gonna turn the wireframes into full visual design then we're gonna get sign off for every single phase then we're gonna be in development\". The thing we hated is we're just on the kind of road to that in some ways. But yeah."

And on the other side, you trust them to not just put you in this cycle of doing like, \"Hey, let's sign a six month contract together and then we'll just do whatever you say\". And if it doesn't work out, you're just working for somebody you're like, \"I don't know why we have to keep doing this.\" But you're stuck doing whatever they say, right? That thing I said earlier about controlling your own time."

  -
    timestamp: "46:35"
    speaker: "Matt"
    content: "I don't know. You've tried that a little bit, too where you've tried to get better at estimating or just taking on a chunk of work as opposed to just run the clock."
  -
    timestamp: "46:43"
    speaker: "Andy"
    content: "Well, so here's the thing. We've always estimated everything from the beginning. Even if we had a policy of not doing anything for a fixed budget for the first four and a half years we were a business. But it didn't mean we weren't estimating things. We were still giving proposals, we were still making estimates for all of our projects ahead of time and if and when things went over we were still dealing with ramifications of that. The client was frustrated and we had to explain why this particular thing and this choice that we made a long time ago made this more time intensive and blah blah blah blah blah. So we had a conversation maybe a year and a half ago about how really, in some ways, there's just basically no difference between giving an estimate upfront and then building hourly for however long it takes and just agreeing to do it for a flat scope. The difference is only this slight... Well, there's just very slight difference between either you are going to have the conversation of, \"Hey, if we do this, we're gonna go over hours because we didn't plan for this\" or you're gonna have the conversation of \"Hey, this is out of scope if you want us to do it, it's gonna cost us much more money\"."
  -
    timestamp: "47:45"
    speaker: "Matt"
    content: "And that's really just the same conversation as far as the client's concern, they don't care. When you give somebody an estimate, they are expecting it's gonna cost pretty much exactly what you said even though, you told them every single time you mentioned it like, \"This is an estimate, nothing is promised, nothing is guaranteed.\" They're expecting it to cost that much until you tell him otherwise, and same goes for a quote. So in some ways it just governs how you internally are going to communicate with your clients about what happens when the unexpected comes up. But yeah unless you're promising to do something without totally scoping it ahead of time, there's really no difference I don't think, in some ways. Am I wrong there?"
  -
    timestamp: "48:25"
    speaker: "Matt"
    content: "Actually, I think you're pretty much right. I just find if you estimated up front set costs, it's a much harder conversation. If you hit that maximum and you're like, \"Hey, things are gonna change.\" But you just have to have a much better reason, than if there's like, \"We'll just work for a period of time together and then we'll either renew that contract or we won't.\""
  -
    timestamp: "48:50"
    speaker: "Andy"
    content: "Maybe that happens more for you than does for us. We've almost never had a contract that was not in somehow, however abstractly tied to some kind of deliverable. We're almost never just hired to do whatever, and whatever comes out of it great. It's always like, \"We need to make this thing, it need to be done by this date, and we have this budget.\" It's like, \"Okay, well we'll try to make that work\""

  -
    timestamp: "49:24"
    speaker: "Matt"
    content: "Essentially. You might be in charge of something. You might be part of a group, but it's just a more flexible structure in that you're not defining up front. You might be like, \"Hey, we're a team of people and we're gonna work on this thing roughly.\" But the contract might not say that, it might be like, \"That's the agreement going into it. The contract is you get X amount of hours, for this period of time,\" And they can change it, if they want to. But it's not exactly the same as getting a freelancer for a rate. Right?"
  -
    timestamp: "49:55"
    speaker: "Andy"
    content: "Yeah, I guess we don't have that many projects like that. And almost all of our stuff, initially was estimate, then we're gonna bill hourly, and the advantage there is that you can kinda very slowly break it to people, that things are going over budget, right? Like, \"This week, we were two hours over on what we thought setting up the models was going to take.\" And things can very slowly escalate, which is maybe a little bit nicer way to break it to people, whereas..."
  -
    timestamp: "50:20"
    speaker: "Matt"
    content: "I guess I am describing it basically, where we're just saying like, \"We're just gonna estimate a thing every two weeks, and then if we go over, we'll just tell you in two week cycles instead of the bigger project.\""
  -
    timestamp: "50:31"
    speaker: "Andy"
    content: "Well, yeah. When you do something flat rate, you're not gonna be like, \"Hey, because of this thing that came up on the what we thought would be a 14-hour task to set up these models, it's now gonna be a 16-hour task, so you have to pay us $150 more.\" Or whatever. You're not gonna do that 'cause it's so small and trivial. So having that hourly sort of model, makes it easier to make things sort of slowly accrue as opposed to like, \"Hey, here's a new feature that we didn't talk about, that wasn't included in the scope, and it's gonna cost this much to add it on.\" Or whatever this sort of conversation looks like for that."
