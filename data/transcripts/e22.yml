    content: "Okay, all right, great. Okay, let's start with that. So I'm Jon Lewis. On the web, you may know me as Umi Workshop. I'm from Hawaii. I ran a creative agency back home a couple of years ago and then I moved to California to work at startups. So the first design business I ever started was my own little shop, and then I went into startups after that, and then founded my own company which I'm running today. So entrepreneurship and then startups, there's a lot of overlaps there, but I'd say that'd be over the course of, I don't know, let's call it 12 years or so, comfortably, without making any weird overlaps in some places where I wasn't getting paid for designing. Which I guess doesn't really count as a business, it's more like charity."

So there's design management that goes into it and a lot of similar things that happen in a design shop, which is great because having run my own studio and worked at other startups, I have a lot of really interesting nuggets to pull and then kinda place into my own world and use them how I see fit or learn from other peoples' mistakes, which is also a thing I'm a big fan of."

    speaker: Maurice
    content: "So for me, and I guess this is the question that we're gonna start off with, which is, \"Why did you decide to start a design business?\" So we can go into answers, but, for me, I was always doing design on the side as a hobby. When I was in high school, when I was in college, I was always doing it on the side, and then I got my first actual legit design job in 2005 and worked in a couple of different companies between 2005 and 2008, most of them either government or tech/Fortune 500-type design companies. Or companies that, I should say, use design; let me not call them design companies. But I was not fulfilled in that work. It was mainly production-based. A lot of contract-type of work, not really fulfilling. And eventually, I just got tired of it and ended up leaving and starting my own studio 'cause I felt I could do better, and now I've been doing that for the past... It'll be nine years in November."

    content: "Do you really wanna know what's in the McRib or do you just want that congealed, sauce-covered meat patty at the end of the day? That's kinda what I felt like I was doing with design, just churning out these rib-shaped patties of websites and it just didn't have any kind of heart or soul or feeling or anything behind it."
  -
    timestamp: "0:05:47"
    speaker: Andy
    content: "Doesn't sound great. That reason is interesting to me, right? The reason of, \"I can do better.\" Did you, at the time, feel like there were other companies that were doing better that you maybe could have gotten jobs at? Did you consider that path or did you really feel like you were the person that had the best opportunity to do the best job in this given circumstance? I'm interested in... So for context, my backstory is I went to school, studied design, got out of school, started a design studio, small design studio that does mostly software and tech work. The most boring story you could possibly have in this particular sector. And when I started the company with a couple of co-founders, the reason we started the company back then, which sounds kind of crazy to say now, in a way, was that we wanted to do design development work for a variety of companies that would allow us to work closely together and continue to learn new skills. And at the time, the options of jobs for designers were you can either work at a design studio, where you probably don't get to do really much related technology aside from branding, or you maybe get to design some screens that you throw over some wall to a development studio that you never gonna speak to, or you could go become a designer in-house somewhere and work on the same product everyday, which I don't mean to slight 'cause I think now I view that differently than I did at the time."

    timestamp: "0:07:14"
    speaker: Andy
    content: "At the time I felt like I didn't wanna work on the same problem; I wanted to get exposed to different industries, different markets and understand different kinds of problems. Now I understand more clearly that even at a company that is solving a relatively simple problem, there's all kinds of layer and depth to that. There's a lot to learn there that maybe I took for granted at the time. But that was why we started the company then, and now that's not the case anymore. Now there are lots of design studios that are doing that work, that do experimental technology things, that have developers and designers working under the same roof. They're doing the kind of work that we strive to do. So that reason is not on the table anymore. So something I've been thinking about lately is what is the reason... To put it plainly, why continue running our own company at this point? We could go get jobs for somebody else and that's something we've been thinking about. So I'm curious to know other reasons for just why people are doing their own thing?"

    timestamp: "0:08:24"
    speaker: Maurice
    content: "And I feel like that can exist in any craft, that passion, and I think running a design shop with that focus is a great reason to start a shop because then you start to have gravity around the way that you work. You attract the sort of people that you wanna work with, and you attract the clients you wanna work for. And without that gravity, you don't really... You kinda have that moment where you're like, \"We're just running through the motions now.\" You kinda lose the passion of what you had when you started, and that's like kind of... Like you hit a ceiling, and do you break through that ceiling? Do you get a new passion? Do you start exploring different areas of design that you didn't explore before? You have to ask yourself all these questions. But for the right team, solving the right types of problems, and if they're doing at a world class level, they never really have to stop. They just kind of have to maybe scale or choose not to, I guess. [chuckle]"
  -
    timestamp: "0:09:24"
    speaker: Matt
    content: "Yeah, that's another option. I always think of it as like... There's the one, yeah, feeling like you could do it better, like Maurice said, or feeling like you have something unique to say. I always thought of the way you would treat the people you work with or the way your company exists in the world as a pretty big motivating factor. You can be in charge of not just the clients you work with and the design work that you do, but how you run your own company, which was... My background is not too dissimilar from Andy's, except that I worked at other places before starting my own studio. Or not... I didn't start it. I joined friends who did and got control, too. So got to..."

    content: "Got to make some decisions but had some foundation for joining."
  -
    timestamp: "0:10:14"
    speaker: Andy
    content: "Yeah, and honestly, that's the reason... That's probably the biggest reason why we continue doing what we're doing here now, is that we have a culture we've built, we have employees, we have an office, we have all of the trappings of a business that gives you momentum and inertia to continue moving forward instead of to stop and change direction and do something else. So it's interesting to me that over the course of our company's life, the initial seed of why we wanted to start was, genuinely, we just wanted to make the kind of job that we wanted and we couldn't find that job anywhere else. We had a combination of designers and developers that were founding the company and the jobs available to us were just not interesting. They weren't things we wanted to be doing, and so we tried to make a space for that to happen. Now that kind of job is much more common so that space is available. If I were graduating today, I would have no excuse to say, \"I have to start my own company 'cause otherwise I'm not gonna be able to be a designer that still learns about Ruby and JavaScript.\" But yeah, so now the reason we continue is that we've started something and it becomes a thing unto itself, which is a whole different motivating reason."

    timestamp: "0:11:23"
    speaker: Andy
    content: "For sure. And I definitely... I do get excited about the things that Matt kind of described. At least theoretically, the idea that you get to make something real in the world that has real impact, right? I've talked to some people before about, \"What is the positive impact in the world of the job that you do,\" and some people are really driven to get a job that... They're working for a non-profit or they're working in some way that is gonna make the world a better place or do some social good. And I felt that pull before, to have a job that really has a big positive impact. And I've talked on this show about how running the studio that we do today, we don't exactly have that. We have some clients that are non-profits we get to work for at a discounted rate, we do get to work for some things I believe in, but more or less, most of our clients are just whoever has money to pay us for our services, we give them the services, they give us the money, end of transaction. And that's not the most purposeful, fulfilling thing day-to-day, but the fact that we get to do that work and provide jobs for people with good healthcare and with reasonable hours and reasonable expectations and flexibility."
  -
    timestamp: "0:12:28"
    speaker: Andy
    content: "At the end of the day, I feel like we've had a positive impact on a few smaller people, very focused, but much larger positive impact on individuals that maybe we could have had on the greater world had we set out with the purpose of ridding the ocean of plastic or whatever our social good kind of mission would be. So that is a thing that definitely is also a motivating factor, the fact that the good you do can be not necessarily directly linked with the work you're doing, if that's a thing you're motivated by."

    content: "Making the money that you want. Finding the clients that you wanted to work for, that would always tell you, \"No,\" and they're gonna go hire these other people. That's hard, that's super tough. I started... I was freelancing on my own while I was working at other places for a really long time before I quit everything and just did my own shop. And because of that, I built all these relationships that didn't... They didn't start to bear fruit until I finally quit my job, and that was still not enough. I quit out of passion because, like we were just talking about, the reason why you start is really important and if you have something pulling you in another direction, then it takes attention away from that reason. So I decided to remove the distractions and eat the pain for just a little while because I know it wasn't gonna be forever. But that is a really difficult part of starting anything, any business."

So I mentioned I didn't start it, I joined something small, and it was just like, \"I'm leaving something very stable that seems like it would be around forever, and I'm gonna go join a thing that might blow up tomorrow.

    timestamp: "0:14:42"
    speaker: Andy
    content: "The hardest part for us... We certainly didn't know what we were doing when we started the company. I've mentioned before that we started the company with no clients, which I only found out after the fact is not normal. You're supposed to get a couple clients first, then start the company."

  -
    timestamp: "0:14:58"
    speaker: Andy
    content: "Well, yeah, I found out after the fact that apparently most people like, \"Oh, we have these people who wanna hire us, I guess we'll start a company so we can fulfill this contract.\" And we were like, \"No, no, you have to make the company first, and then the contracts magically appear like the Field of Dreams,\" which is not of course how it went. So we started really rough and tumble, which... Not rough and tumble, we started very cheaply. In Baltimore, we all rented the same house and we all kind of lived in the same space, had no extra room, it was very intimate and very money-efficient, let's say, which allowed us a little more flexibility to be idiots at the beginning and kinda screw things up and do it wrong until we found our feet under us. But yeah, I think that the hardest part for us at the very beginning was definitely finding those first relationships that would then splinter and branch into other kind of long-term relationships. One of the things that... Depending on the kind of work you're doing, there's always this kind of catch-22; it's like if you're doing consulting work, you just aren't getting paid unless you are doing work, but also you need to be finding the next work to be doing when this current thing you're doing ends, and this kind of non-stop ouroboros of you have to be working, and also finding more work all the time."

    timestamp: "0:16:13"
    speaker: Andy
    content: "It really isn't. So some of the first times that we got clients that felt like they'd be long relationships and have, we've had some clients now for five years, so some of those early relationships that we started to build made it seem like, \"Oh, this actually might be sustainable 'cause we can start to build these pillars and foundational relationships with certain clients and then use the extra time to find other things and branch out.\" But yeah, finding that first work definitely was... It feels kind of obvious to say it, but though it's worth saying that, yes, the hardest part is finding someone to pay you for the thing that you think you're good at and haven't ever demonstrated before that you're actually good at, necessarily."

    timestamp: "0:17:04"
    speaker: Matt
    content: "I had it solved for a very short period of time, but that only really happened because I was on my own at that point and so it meant that anytime when I was super overwhelmed and busy, I would pull in other designers to help me. And that's before I had started the shop, so I would collab with other people on projects that were overwhelming for me, and then, when I didn't need them, then they would just... They would go off and do their own thing. And then... So everything was kind of fluctuating all the time, whereas when you run a shop, [chuckle] once I opened the doors to an agency, that problem happened, but we also had a really broad offering of services, so no one area of the company was ever suffering more than... To the point where it would sink everything. So diversifying the team and the things that you can solve, it doesn't necessarily mean all design services necessarily, it could mean event planning that involves design as a separate service attached to it and stuff like that. But just being really, really, I guess... What's the word? Cross-disciplinary can solve that problem, I think. In the right marketplace anyway."

    content: "Yeah, part of it is I think you just have to... First of all, I do think finding ongoing sources of income, even if they are relatively smaller than these brief flash in the pan, big contracts that come through, and demand a lot of time and attention, and they pay a lot for short period of time. I do think they're trying to build up a foundation. Whatever your type of business is, we're talking about general design entrepreneurship here, so this could be... In our case, it's largely doing maintenance on websites we built. So, \"We built this website but, hey, just so you know, websites are constantly destroying themselves all the time, as technology changes and evolves, they're just constantly dying and pieces are breaking and they're missing updates, and so they do require a constant attention.\" So that's the way that looks for us, right? And we have ongoing contracts, that is maintenance contracts with our clients to make sure that everything keeps going as expected. And in some cases, we even have a little bit of time set aside to continue improving little things as they come up. But for other people, you could be on a retainer with somebody to design certain types of things for them or find a client that has ongoing needs."

    content: "There's this really interesting concept that's starting to pop up with product design shops where they'll engage in projects with early stage startups and then take equity in the project and the companies. And I think that that concept is pretty brilliant, especially if you're building great, great products, and you're also setting up those companies to survive without your assistance to the point where they're... Obviously they're gonna hire their teams and they're gonna replace all the services that you offer, but, at some point, you'll receive some dividends from taking the risk on that company as a long-term client. And I think MetaLab does this. Bakken & Baeck, they have a whole situation with ventures that they do. I feel like if I run a studio again, I would definitely wanna explore that concept because I would be wanna be building really great products, the kinds that I wouldn't be able to maintain forever, 'cause they would need to scale."

So I think if you're gonna do that, you have to approach it the same way that an investor approaches investing in startups, which is to say that you need to invest in a lot of them. You can't say, \"Oh, yeah, we're gonna have two clients and we're gonna take a deep discount on our rate because we're gonna take a little bit of share and equity this product because they're working in an area where it's understood that 95% of them are gonna fail, but the 5% that succeed are gonna exceed well beyond anyone's imagination and make back enough money that it's okay the 95% of the other investments didn't pay off.\""

The other thing that came up for us whenever we've discussed this in the past and or experimented with it is that, there's a line when you're doing design and development services between what's kind of your responsibility and what's the responsibility of your clients. And when you're starting to take a share in their success, that line gets blurrier because all of a sudden you're like, \"Wait a minute, what are your credentials to be the CEO of this company? And how are you gonna run sales? And what's your plan for this other things,\" that normally you have no say as a designer/developer. All of a sudden you're like, \"Wait, wait, if I'm gonna be putting my investment in this, I'm gonna believe in this thing enough that I'm gonna basically pay effectively money into it, I'm gonna take less payment on my work to hope in the success of this.\" Then you have to ask a whole bunch of questions, which the times we've tried to go down that road oftentimes lead to that idea getting taken off the table. We're like, \"Hey, what about these things?\" And, \"Can we get access the financials,\" and, \"Can you tell us how you're funded,\" and \"Oh, no, no, that's okay. We'll pay you for this. We don't wanna take a discount for this.\""

You are invested in their success, so that's like your motivations are no longer just to bill as many hours and make the client happy, which frankly is your normal motivation as set up by the normal consulting system. Your motivation is now to invest in the success of this thing, even if it means working more hours than you said you'd work or if it means pushing back on something and making the client unhappy 'cause you're gonna advocate for the end user instead of their happiness. I like all of that. I think that, in our experience, at least for us, it's been more complicated than that. We haven't been able to pull it off. We are actually experimenting a little bit with it, so maybe I'll report back later, but I think it's nice."

If you just wanted a set of hands to work on whatever this is that you needed done, you could've went to a marketplace or something and hired someone half a world away that would do it for pennies on the dollar, and if that's what you need, that's what you need.

As your business changes, hopefully all of that stuff changes as well. You decide, \"Oh, I need to add this to my document,\" or \"I need to add this to my contract.\" 'Cause sometimes things will happen and you realize, \"Oh, I didn't plan for X contingency, but now I know for the next time that that's what I need to do.\" In my early days with my contract, I think I probably started out like lot of designers or design entrepreneurs might, with just like a standard template that you get from AIGA or something like that, and you try to work it to your will. I quickly kind of thought that that probably wasn't the best thing 'cause I am not a lawyer. So I found a lawyer and I bartered my services for... I said, \"If you could look over my contract and help me figure out X, Y, Z things I need to do, I'll do some design work for your firm.\""

If I find myself doing the same kind of work the same kind of way for a couple of years in a row, I feel like that's gonna be a sign that I need to change something up and move around. And starting my own company has offered me the opportunity to do all kinds of learning in all kinds of areas which I never thought I would need to learn anything in or never expected would be a skill I would pick up. One of those skills is collections, right? Like we went four-and-a-half years without anybody refusing to pay an invoice for any reason, which I'm proud of 'cause I think generally indicates that our communications were clear with our clients and they understood what the deal was and that we did good work and no one wanted to contest that. And then, at the four-and-a-half year mark, people just stopped paying all of a sudden and my job became mostly collections man. That was my role at the company 'cause I'm the meanest of all the people here, by a wide margin."

And some things, you're like, \"I absolutely need to be paid for this\", and some things you're like, \"Well, this is a really interesting, cool project and it would fit really well into what I'm trying to display myself as, so I will do this for next to nothing or whatever.\" But along with that, the longer you do that, the more comfortable you become having a passive business where nothing is really growing. You're just doing lot of work for a lot of different people, and you're also getting a ton of terrible referrals. Nothing's going up. And so over the years... And that was really, really early, before I had any notable work to attract actual... Any real good business, but the more good work I did and the more visible I became and the more I was competing with larger agencies, the more I was able to work myself into those circles and learn by osmosis through the people that work in much more efficiently-oiled machines than what I was running."

They know about it now. [chuckle] As opposed to a while ago where it was just like, \"Yeah, yeah, go talk to Umi, he'll hook this up for you over the weekend because that dude does not sleep, and he'll make it happen and it'll be the best thing you've ever seen, and don't tell him I told you this but he's not gonna charge you that much.\" And I had an entire body of work built on that kind of word-of-mouth, and it was all happening behind my back, which was weird 'cause you'd like to think your referrals are looking out for you, but what are you gonna do?

You are actually better at doing that now and a little less good at doing everything else. We took one project three and a half years ago that we talked about... It was a little bit different than what we normally wanna do. The difference was that we're a design and development studio and we think that the strength in our work is from the fact that all of our designers understand technology intimately, all of our developers understand design and care about user experience and understand why decisions are being made. And it's all happening under the same roof, which means that we can save a bunch of time without having to elucidate every single design decision very clearly and make pixel-perfect screens of every single view and mock them up with notes to make sure it gets built perfectly. We can communicate much more efficiently and just doing it all in one spot is much easier."

I don't think any of the projects that directly came as referrals to this particular project I'm mentioning ever ended up working out. Not just... It wasn't just us philosophically turning away projects that won't work in letting us design them. It was also other reasons that things didn't work out, but... But yeah, that effect has been so strong, where it's just like, man, this one thing we did just happens to have had a pretty far reach, and we didn't happen to have the exact role we wanted in that project and now we get that kind of work dumped on us a lot. And we have to fight uphill in every single conversation. We're like, \"No, no, no, but we are also very good at this and this is how we do our best work, and this is why we do our best work that way and why we have this kind of things in place.\" And so yeah, it's been interesting to feel that, and how intense that is when you have a project that... Maybe it's not exactly you wanted to do. Guess what? It's what you do. [chuckle] If you did it, it's what you do now. It doesn't matter that it's not what you really wanna do and wasn't perfect."

But we definitely found that it's just... It's way harder than we thought it would be, I'll put it there. It's way harder than we thought it would be to actually make time for that when you are willing to give up things on your other contracts because it's just... It's so easy for that to just to become what you do and then you just kind have fall into that thing of, \"Well, that's more good money, more good money, more good money.\" And then you look back three years later and, \"Oh, look, we only do this now. When did that happen? We haven't done a project that are like the projects we want to do in forever, we only do these other projects.\" Which, again, depending on your motivations, if your motivations is like, \"I want to run a business, I'm a business person,\" then that is what you should be doing.

But none of that is worth anything if you don't have the luxury of saying no. If you have to say yes to certain projects, then you're just... You have to compromise, and that's unfortunate, but when you do have those stints of time where you get to work on things that actually... That you really care about, I feel like it's super fulfilling. It reminds you why you started in the first place."

And we wanna take on projects in Elixir 'cause its interesting, it's... It would be a dream if that was like... If we were always working in that language in the Phoenix framework. So how do we do that? We need to put that out in the world and go find those people. So we've been sending the dev team to conferences, trying to put the landing pages on the website, trying to see if clients would be open to using that on their project. I don't know if I have a huge success story yet, it's a pretty new initiative, but we've been thinking about that and trying to figure out ways to do that. 'Cause I think we wanna figure out ways to do that and figure out ways to get into maybe new spaces that we are not currently in, like, \"What... Who designs VR projects? What is that gonna be like?\" So I think we're in the midst of trying figure stuff out like that, like, \"How do we market that as a service?\""

And, I will say that we have talked about this in the abstract a number of time, and anytime it gets any less than completely abstract, we immediately have no idea what to do or what makes any sense. [chuckle] Our clients are coming from a wide variety of backgrounds, we don't work in a specific industry, we kind of work all over the place: Different for-profit businesses, nonprofits, cultural institutions, schools and colleges, all kinds of stuff. Just individuals that have ideas that wanna pay someone to build them. So we're kind of all over the place there. And importantly, we don't take on that many projects, we have like fewer high-value contracts. I would say in a given year, we probably have maybe like 12 to 18 contracts total, so we're not taking on a huge volume of work so it's not like we're trying to get 50 new clients next year, we're just really trying to find the twelve that are really good fits and are gonna be projects that are meaningful and allows to do our best work. And the best we've tried is kinda what Matt described, right? Let's just write on our website, we wanna do it, maybe that'll work, and our experience is just that that does not work. That does not count as active marketing."

The one thing I think that helps with it is like, you had a meeting with somebody, you got to talk about this, and then they get to see the things you talked about reflected on their website... On your website, if they go to look at it for confirmation. I think that's helpful there, but I don't think anyone has ever Googled like, \"Baltimore Design Development Studio,\" and found Friends of the Web. Not only because I'm sure we're nowhere near the top results for that, but also because I can't imagine the kind of client that would be Googling that [laughter] and would also be the kind of partner we'd want. And so my inability to really correctly identify who our partners and future partners are going to be, and then know how to reach them effectively has lead to literally zero active marketing. We just don't do anything 'cause we're not sure what we would do. And in that sense, I guess we've been very privileged that we've been able to survive for six years without having to ever take out an advertisement or really try to market ourselves."

They don't... [chuckle] They seem they seem new, I bet it's not very expensive.\" And we did a good job and it snowballed from there. So yeah. I don't know how to do that, is the answer, and when I think about it, it makes me feel like a bit of a fraud because we just don't do that.

'Cause I do work on the side all the time. And some of the work I enjoy the most is with people that I worked with five, six years ago. They still have their businesses and they still have design services they need fulfilled and we still enjoy working with each other. So that stream exists, but when I'm talking about looking for something new and fresh, it almost all depends on what the season is 'cause I enjoy designing products, but I am not in a position to dedicate 70% of my time to doing that, right? So I can only really work with certain types of teams. There has to be a lot of chemistry to begin with. And those are like... They're soft qualities, but the word travels fast in certain circles. So for example, having worked on a project called Elevate a few years ago, after that app launched, it won App of the Year and then I had a ton of referrals from people I'd never heard of before. They were just like, \"Oh my God, can you do this for me? Make me App of the Year.\" As if I'm gonna make that."

And because of that, as long as it's in the same caliber of talent and the same values, you know you're traveling in the right pool. And that's a great pool for me to pick work from if I absolutely need it. Because I'm not in the situation to really go into that, it doesn't go much further. But if I were to open a shop tomorrow and I needed work tomorrow and I needed to support three employees, I would have to make a lot of phone calls. That would be my active marketing. It wouldn't be writing blog posts, it wouldn't be tweeting about crypto-currency because I wanna work on crypto-currency. I would be making phone calls to people at Coin Base, and I would be talking to people at BuzzFeed because I wanna work on motion graphics or something like that.

Thinking about this further, this may just be more personal to me and less abstract about Friends of the Web, but I think this direct marketing thing is just a big blind spot for me. And another example is just this very podcast, I have no clue how to get more people to be aware this podcast exists. I'm very proud of it, more proud of it than the other podcasts we've made in the past that had more listeners. We have been putting up the show regularly for almost a year now, and we had basically the same listenership since the show launched, with very little kind of growth there. It's a decent listenership, it's fine. I'm very happy, I'm glad you're all listening. I love you all very much, I'm not trying to go find more people, but the reason we make this is because we want people to hear it, we're proud of it, and I genuinely don't know what to do. I tried the thing I did in college, which was just I emailed all the design blogs and said like, \"Will you please write about this?\" And just heard back from nobody and I just... I'm kind of at a loss. I don't know what else to do other than just rely on people that know the thing to tell other people."

So if you make something great, it will just naturally travel to the ends of the world, which is truly how I felt. I would say eight years ago, I was like, \"If you made something great, of course it will become popular.\" And now I have seen so clearly through so many very direct examples that that is so far from the truth. The popularity of something is almost completely disconnected from how great it might be and how people respond to it. You can pour enough marketing dollars into something to make the world's most boring, crappy thing a worldwide trending sensation, and you can have something amazing and wonderful that nobody knows about, and just doesn't... Yeah, exactly, just evaporates into thin air. So I know, I know in my brain that we can't just make a good podcast and then rely on everyone telling their friends and it spreading naturally and kind of organically, but I don't know what else to do. Facebook ads? Promoted tweets? These seem like insane ideas to me, but maybe they're not."

I'm terrible at marketing Lunch, and that is largely because I'm doing a podcast, and I'm also working on other things, and so even though I am doing work through my studio, it kind of falls on the back burner as it turns to the website and to social media, and how do you keep up in Instagram? And should you have an Instagram? And an active Twitter and an active Facebook page? And what's the right balance to strike between these sort of active, outward social channels and the work that you do 'cause you don't want it to seem like you're posting on social media all day and not doing work, but you also don't wanna work so much that there's no activity on your social media. So it's like, what is that trade off as it relates to the active marketing? And that was actually a big reason why I decided to rebrand and rename my business was because 318 Media, when I started off, it sounded like a kitschy name at first, but then people kept misspelling it because I had an unconventional spelling for it, there were other companies in my city that had similar Three-dash-dash names, like 360 Media, 352 Media, and people were getting us confused.

Is that the sort of thing that clients will like as it relates to my work or will people look at it and think that it's too puerile?\" So it's... I'm always kind of struggling with that, with trying to figure out what the balance is. I wish I could tell you I'm good at it. I'm not. [laughter] I think I'm fairly good at marketing myself and the work that I'm doing, but as it relates to kind of the business, not so much. I'm still working on it. It's something that is still an active thing that I work on. And again, to kinda transition this into scaling 'cause we've all sort of talked about this, as you grow and as your business grows, as you reach that vantage point of, \"Okay, I can't just do this alone.

I saw it as like, \"Oh, I'm not just interacting with friends anymore. I should be more aware of my surroundings.\" But I haven't felt it as much as the way we portray the company. Maybe just because we're not doing as much as some other companies are, 'cause everything seems to be through referral from people we've worked with before. But it's challenging just not in the outward facing way, I've found."

    content: "The scaling thing, we've had an interesting relationship with that over the past three years. We never started the company with the goal of making it a big company, which I think is a distinction. Some people start a company and they're like, \"The goal is grow it as much as I can because that means that I'm accomplishing my mission on a bigger scale, and it means I'm making more money, and it means I'm just doing more, more, more of the thing that I wanna do.\" Our goal was never that. Our goal was to do the thing we wanted to do on a small scale and just to kind of make good jobs for us and a few people that we found that would fit in with us nicely and would be good candidates for the jobs. So we never wanted to scale. At our peak, I think we found ourselves at 10 full-time employees, and as of today, right now, we are down to six. So we actually have scaled down over the past two years, which was not an active choice, we didn't like... There was no layoffs. It was just some people found new things they wanted to do, and that coincided with less work coming in the door, and it just kind of naturally worked itself out, more or less."

    content: "So we kinda find ourselves almost back at the place where we started and having the conversation of like... Now we kind of have an opportunity to say we learned a lot from having a consulting business that did the kind of consulting work it described, from growing it from four people to around 10-ish. I say 10-ish 'cause there was part-time people here and there, every now and then. So it was never full, easy-to-measure number. And then scaling back down, now the question is, \"Is what we did over the past six years exactly what we wanted to do? Is there something we could have done differently and learned from?\" And those are some discussions we're gonna be having internally because the scaling thing... I don't think the scale is what got us. I think people say that scaling is when businesses are at risk because now you've increased your expenses, and you're having to increase your income commensurately, and if you don't do that then the whole thing would kinda blow up. It's not really what happened to us, our story is different, and I can complain to you about it sometime over a drink if you want, but not now."

We can have more people have a good job from this, and this is not gonna like... \" It was never getting to the point where it was gonna affect our day-to-day. It wasn't like we were gonna hire 20 people and no longer would I be a designer. I would just be a manager and I would just be overseeing people and in meetings all day. It was just like, \"Oh, we got to do this in a little bit bigger scale.\" And so we got to experience that a little bit. And now we're kind of back down to a smaller scale and are reevaluating whether or not it's a value we have, to grow the company."

I've witnessed it at other companies... And I've seen it from really far away vantage points. I have friends that worked at places that scaled grotesquely, and then a certain CEO showed up and fired a bunch of people. Like, thousands of people."

    content: "It's... There should always be a reason for the pace, I think. And I think, for me, culture is a really big part of the workplace, whether it's remote or not. I just think the internal culture of a company has to scale with the number of people that are involved in it. Not just inside, but also outside. The way that the public views your company, the sentiment should match the pace of your scale and all that. And it's a really difficult dance and not a lot people are very good at controlling that, but I think for me, at my company... Very early on, we had a lot of internal documents just specifically for, \"This is what it looks like to handle this sort of situation,\" or, \"This is how we present ourselves when we speak to people outside the company,\" and that sort of stuff sort of... It helps everybody set expectations on what the scale trajectory looks like because without that, you dump a bunch of people in a room and you don't have time to set expectations because you have work to do. And without that very squishy human aspect aligned, you can end up with a lot of chaos. And that's totally removed from the money aspect of scaling a company, totally separate, and when those two things collide, then you end up with a lot of room for making terrible, terrible mistakes."

Maybe they're a young person that can't find a job they want. They might consider starting their own company. Maybe they are kind of disillusioned with their current job. I'm curious to know what piece of advice each of us would have for somebody that might be looking to start their own business, given the experiences we've each had. So let's end it there, if that's all right with you, Maurice. And who wants to start it off?"

    content: "I think... I'm always very grateful that I made the move that I did, in kind of going from something very stable to something unsure, but more control. I also think I'm getting to a point where like maybe the first bit of time seemed like, \"Well, let's figure out how to survive. Okay, now we know how to do that, now let's do it with some purpose.\" Feels like we're getting a place where we really need to establish exactly what our joint vision is and figure out where we go next now that we know we probably can survive or it seems that way. I would just say if you're considering something like that, one thing I would note is if your favorite thing is designing stuff and you wanna be left alone all day to design stuff, that's probably not a good choice to start... [chuckle] To start a business, like all of the things you've heard in this podcast of like, \"You wanna learn how to be collection agency? You're probably gonna be a little bit of that. It's not super fun, but if you wanna have full control over stuff, well, guess what, you've got a lot of control over stuff.\" But if you feel like you have something, if you feel like you can do it better, if you feel like you have something unique to say, if you have that vision and wanna execute on it like, you kinda have to do it."

    speaker: Maurice
    content: "Yeah, I agree with that. I think if you're gonna start this off, have a plan going into it and then have a plan to get out of it. For a lot of us, and I'm putting my own self in this bucket too, you get into this and you realize, and we talked about this little earlier, like why do you continue? You get into this, of course you have all the best reasons in the world to get into it. You wanna work for yourself, you wanna have your own clients, have your own say, but then you realize the more and more that you do this, you're taking on more and more responsibilities. There are just other types of fires that tend to crop up and things like that, and sometimes it's hard to think, \"Well, how do I get out of this? Can I go back to a regular job, nine-to-five or something like that?\" And I think that can be pretty difficult, especially if you've been doing it for a long time and you get into a certain pattern, it becomes harder to find the thing that will get you out of it. So, I think whether you're considering this or even if you're already into design entrepreneurship, give yourself an exit strategy. I think that's very important."

    content: "Well, for those of you who are listening right now to the sound of my voice and you happen to be running your own business as a designer, congratulations, you've made it this far [chuckle] and bless your little souls. I'm with you. It hurts sometimes, but don't forget we're practicing our craft and hopefully you love it more than you hate it. For people that are thinking about starting any kind of business, specifically design-focused, I think the first group of people I was just addressing will agree with me, no one tells you that... How hard it's gonna be. And nobody can really articulate specifically to you how hard it's going to be because every individual is different. And the thing about entrepreneurship is it's... Anyone can do it, but certain people are built for it. And you can definitely make a lot of mistakes or learn from other people's mistakes and become good at it. So if it's your dream to run your own business, it's not impossible. Anything is possible, but it might take a lot longer than you think, it's gonna be a lot harder than you think, and you're gonna have a lot more responsibilities that are gonna be created that maybe you didn't think you'd ever have to be responsible for."

All that stuff is kinda up to you and if you drop the ball, you're gonna feel really, really bad about it if it completely explodes. And trust me, those people already... They've figured out what their exit plan is already."

And I think just be respectful of that, first and foremost, and the reason why you got into it, and just try to have as many conversations about that as often as you feel is healthy because if you lose that through-line, then when that monkey wrench comes in, it's gonna knock that Jenga set over, it's just house of cards, it's all over. And that's not a stressful... It's not a good environment for anybody to come to work to either. But on the good side, the upside, if you're making money doing what you love, and that's kinda like what capitalism has prevented a lot of people from doing."

[chuckle] But the thing that, there is something in there to take away, which is just that I think a lot of people, especially younger people, underestimate the responsibility that's gonna come with starting your own company. And I think that when people think about responsibility, they think about it in a purely practical sense like, \"Yeah, yeah, yeah, responsible, I get it. I'll run payroll on time and I'll make sure that we have healthcare. I can do those things.\" The responsibility for me has always been a much more emotional thing, like, \"Yeah, sure, I can do the logistical parts,\" but the emotional wear that comes from having that responsibility is very real and something that I don't think should be underestimated. I felt like I was prepared for the logistical challenges of running your own company, but I was not at all prepared for the emotional challenges. But I think, especially men, for example, do a much worse job communicating about. I was not prepared for how hard it would be to do those things and to have that responsibility emotionally."

And I think so few people that run companies treat themselves with that same respect and empathy, right? They understand like, \"Yeah, yeah. I won't work my employees for 60 hours a week,\" but then they themselves are burning the candle at both ends 'cause they feel like they have to. So you're your own employee when you start your own company, and treat yourself with the same empathy and respect and care that you would anybody else who would be working with you."
