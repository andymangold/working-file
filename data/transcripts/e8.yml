    content: "I don't feel that way, Matt, but I appreciate that compliment. There's this guy, he's been hanging around a little bit, and I met him through some friends. And he is basically trained as a graphic designer, he worked at a graphic design studio doing branding and more typical, air quotes, graphic design work. And he's trying to basically move over and start doing more product design work, so websites, apps, that kind of thing; it's like software design. And he basically reached out to me 'cause he's in this program, which is like a bootcamp-y, kind of like rapid education, like a six-week, 10-week program, or whatever to bring people up to speed on a new type of thing, and that thing is product design, in this instance."

    timestamp: "03:57"
    speaker: Andy
    content: "And it's been a weird... It's been a very organic mentorship kind of role that came out of nowhere, which was interesting and welcome. I thought it was very fun to have somebody that I could talk about and introduce to this whole career, which I've been doing for six years now, and show them the ropes a little bit, and offer a little bit of a foil to the things that he was being taught in his formal courses. Anyway, the whole thing, it made me feel good. Selfishly, it was like, \"Oh, I have knowledge to share with this person. It feels really good to feel like I actually have a crude, some sort of expertise and experience over these past six years that I actually can pass on to somebody.\" Which made me realize that I think up until this moment, I've really been struggling with the fact that I don't actually feel that way on a day-to-day basis. Most days, I actually really struggle with the sense of not really feeling like what I'm contributing to a project is really valuable because I've gotten to this point where I kind of... The way I think about design is less specialized and more just a generalist, make sure everything is considered and happens, and gets put together."

    timestamp: "05:04"
    speaker: Andy
    content: "And so, I have a lot of issues in my life, but you would not normally criticize me as being somebody who doesn't have confidence. Self-esteem and sort of a sense of self-worth is never really a weakness of mine. So it was interesting for me to realize that this was actually a situation where I had been undervaluing myself for a long time, or at least, in my own mind, thinking of my contributions to the team as not special and not valuable. And having this sort of new person who was coming into the industry fresh allowed me to see clearly that, \"Oh no, I actually do have something to bring to the table.\" And so, I wanted to discuss that because I think a lot of people struggle with lack of sense of self-worth, a lack of confidence in their career, and I think some of that is specific to design, and it's not something that gets talked about a lot. So, Matt, how do you feel about yourself right now? "

  -
    timestamp: "06:00"
    speaker: Matt
    content: "Oh, I feel great! I think I probably have a similar internal self-worth, and then the way people would probably assume I feel about myself, which is that I probably... If you asked someone else, they probably think, \"I bet Matt thinks he's great.\" And then, internally, I think, \"I don't know. I don't know if I'm so good at this.\""
  -
    timestamp: "06:22"
    speaker: Andy
    content: "To be fair, Matt, you do say pretty often, \"Matt's great, Matt's great, I'm great.\" [chuckle] I've heard you say that many times."

    timestamp: "06:35"
    speaker: Victoria
    content: "I think that's pretty relatable."

    timestamp: "06:37"
    speaker: Andy
    content: "You said, yes, Victoria, you feel that way too? "
  -
    timestamp: "06:39"
    speaker: Victoria
    content: "Not necessarily; I didn't say that's for myself, but I think a lot of people feel like that. That's one of the most common things that I hear, is people saying, \"Oh, I project more self-confidence than I have.\""
  -
    timestamp: "06:50"
    speaker: Matt
    content: "Yeah, I think it's one, self-defense, and then, two, \"How are you gonna get any work if other people don't believe in you, or you don't make other the people believe in you?\" So it's a self-defense mechanism and a sales tactic, I guess. But I can't say that I don't suffer from the same thing you do, Andy, especially when you're maybe interacting with the same people over and over again, and just the novelty of what you do, or the skill set that you have, it's expected and it's the norm."
  -
    timestamp: "07:22"
    speaker: Andy
    content: "Yeah, that feels like a big part of it. I think when you're in the same context, and you're talking to the same people over and over again, you lose a sense of what you're contributing as being special or meaningful. It just feels like, \"Oh yeah, well, if I wasn't here, surely, somebody else here would just have the same thoughts I'm having. I'm just a weird proxy for this idea; I'm not actually contributing something directly.\" Usually, something I felt."
  -
    timestamp: "07:44"
    speaker: Matt
    content: "Or even if it's new people, but they're clients, the fact that they're paying you money means it's expected that you would have the skill set, so of course, why would you not? As opposed to, I don't know, interacting with somebody in a completely different capacity where she's like, \"Oh wait, you know how to do that?\" I don't know, meeting someone at a party and explaining something might be a little bit different than selling yourself to somebody and saying, \"I'm worth this amount of money.\""
  -
    timestamp: "08:09"
    speaker: Andy
    content: "Yeah, I don't get that sense of validation from clients, ever. Sure, clients, oftentimes, have told me directly, or told our company, they're like, \"You did a great job! Everything came out good!\" Express some appreciation or validation for our value. But that never does it for me. I guess I always feel like in that situation, it's somebody else's contributions that are really responsible for the success of the thing. Or that because that is the expected way that relationship is supposed to go, that it's just normal for them to be happy. And if they're unhappy, then I failed. And if they're happy, then I guess I'm just barely getting by, whatever."
  -
    timestamp: "08:51"
    speaker: Matt
    content: "Yeah right, exactly. It's like if the movers ding your furniture, I'm very upset with the movers; if they do everything perfectly, it's like \"Well, of course, that was what they were supposed to do.\""

    speaker: Andy
    content: "Everything got moved. Kara, what is your perspective on this? Do you struggle with a sense of confidence and your self-worth as a designer? "
  -
    timestamp: "09:07"
    speaker: Kara
    content: "Don't think I do in the day-to-day professional environment of not feeling qualified, or I feel like, I don't know, the work that I'm doing isn't important, or whatever. I do feel like I've felt that a lot of... I feel like I'm good at the type of design that I do. And if I try to do a type of design that I haven't done before, I'm not good at, then I feel like those feelings come up of... I don't know if you wanna call it \"imposter syndrome\" or something like that. But I don't feel like that really happens when I'm in an environment doing the work that I'm doing in a day job environment around the people that I work with, if that answers the question."
  -
    timestamp: "09:53"
    speaker: Andy
    content: "Yeah, I think you're saying you have a very healthy relationship with things, which is that the things you are good at, you feel comfortable doing and confident. And the things you're unfamiliar with, I think justifiably, you might feel less confident because they're not your main things, that's sort of new territory. That sounds like the correct way to feel. [laughter] As opposed to the way I feel, which is that there's a thing that I know I'm good at, I've been doing it for a long time, and yet, I don't feel the emotional benefit of it all the time. I oftentimes don't feel inside of my heart, and then soul that I'm doing something good and it's worthwhile, which is maybe a deeper-seated issue."
  -
    timestamp: "10:32"
    speaker: Matt
    content: "I think I've also heard you just point out things that you've never done before, and just say, \"I'm pretty sure I'd be great at that if I decided to dedicate the time to do it.\""
  -
    timestamp: "10:39"
    speaker: Andy
    content: "Well, that's the thing. [laughter] Like I said, confidence is not usually a thing that I have an issue with at all. And I do subscribe to that vision of the world, Matt, which is that I think the things that I'm not good at, I'm not good at because I haven't tried, or practiced, or really put the effort in to be good at. Which is to say that, yeah, I think if I wanted to become a, insert whatever, as long as it doesn't require some biological advantage... I'm not gonna become a great NBA player, it's never gonna happen; I've got some limitations there. But something that's mental or a task. I don't think just me; I think people can learn to become good at almost anything. So yeah, it's all messy. So I'm curious, Victoria, you are pursuing, perhaps, a more specific type of career than the rest of us, in that the work you're doing is, I don't know how to put it."

    content: "Well, Kara talked about how she feels. Sometimes, she's in a situation where she's expected to do a type of design she's not familiar with, it's not her normal type of work; therefore, she feels out of place a little bit, as we all would. Do you ever feel that way? Or do you feel like you are doing the thing you're expected to be doing? What's your whole relationship to this? "
  -
    timestamp: "11:54"

  -
    timestamp: "12:12"
    speaker: Victoria
    content: "Well, no, but probably not. Just that I started doing my job when they were still training me, so I'm getting there, I'm almost there to where I don't need someone constantly fixing what I'm doing. Say your question again."
  -
    timestamp: "12:29"
    speaker: Andy
    content: "Well, my question was going to be: If you did agree that there was some more structure to the kind of work you're doing, then... For example, some days, I'm designing websites and apps, which there's a certain amount of structure to that. And some days, the design work I'm doing is something, it may be totally unrelated. Now we have to make a compelling app icon, which is a type of design that I, frankly, have never been that good at, where it's like, let's just... You have to make a cool something. There's not really limitations, there's not a use case; you just have to make this cool and interesting. That kind of... I don't know how to describe it. That kind of visual image making, it's never been a thing that was a strength of mine. And I end up in those situations. Do you feel like there's that same diversity in type design where you end up doing things that you don't identify with as your main type of type design? Or? "

    speaker: Victoria
    content: "Okay, yeah, yeah. No, no, no, I get a better idea of what you mean now. Sure, I haven't drawn a sans serif of my own yet; it's just more specific. I think I have more of a specialty in script-like things, working on that. But just in general, I don't know, I feel like when I was really insecure and anxious that my career was going to be a total flop, that was where I placed all of my self-worth just because it was a thing that hadn't happened yet. But now that it's gonna be okay, going okay, I feel like I don't put so much of my self-worth into... I don't bury it all in my work, I don't put it all there. Does anyone else feel like that? I was thinking about this."

    timestamp: "14:31"
    speaker: Matt
    content: "I first felt that way, but I don't know if it's in a less healthy where I feel like when I was learning more, I assumed I'd hit... I may either learned something, or there'd be some sort of achievement, and that would make me feel better about my success, or whatever I had accomplished. And then you hit those milestones, you're like, \"Wow! This doesn't make everything better. It's really not as there is something here.\""

    speaker: Victoria
    content: "Yeah, I think so."
  -
    timestamp: "15:07"
    speaker: Kara
    content: "I think I've felt that, too, of... I haven't had a ton of official professional experience, but I've always felt confident in my abilities, or I'm confident in my ability to solve problems. But once I had some professional evidence that had a certain kind of name attached to it, that, I think, helped me gain that confidence. And I feel like anybody who is walking out of school, or who is starting out their career who doesn't have that evidence, those feelings, feel a lot more vicious even though you might be confident in your own ability. You might not be able to show it so easily."

I can dismiss it, but I don't think that's what, personality-wise, is my first inclination. I think my first inclination is like, \"Thank you, I know it's great.\""

Just wait until next time.\" Which is how I felt about most of my career is like, \"Well, next time, I'll do better. And next time... \" There's always next time, and it's never now.

So I'm more likely to see the world that way. But it feels like I am more confident in a conversation with another designer about myself, and what I bring to the table, and my expertise, and experience, than I am in a conversation with somebody who's perhaps a software developer, or somebody that is working in business, like the CEO of a big company, or somebody that comes from a different field. Because I think a lot of my hangups are tied up in design's role in a bigger project, which I oftentimes feel like doesn't actually carry the weight that maybe I was taught it carried, or maybe that I hope it actually carried."

And as long as it does the stuff it says it's gonna do, it doesn't really matter what color we choose for the buttons, and what font we pick.\" All that stuff is just set dressing. I think a lot of that undermines, in my own mind, my value because it's like, \"Well, the more I learn about this, the more I feel like the decisions that I was trained to make like color, composition, graphic design things, the more I feel like those things don't actually really matter.\" And so, I'm on this weird feedback loop of the more I learn and the more experience I get, the less I actually think the things that I know about really carry weight."

It's just to say that it's making those decisions that's important, and where I sit right now in February 2017, Andy Mangold, I feel like design's job is to be an overarching voice in the conversation deciding about what the thing should be. I expect engineers to look at the world as an engineer would look at the world. And I think your job as an engineer is, \"Well, we have to make this efficient, we have to make it reasonable to build, we have to figure out how these things are gonna technically work.\" And that's supposed to be your focus if you're an engineer. You're not really supposed to, as an engineer, be thinking about, \"How is this going to make a bunch of money?\" Or, \"What are we gonna do about this kind of audience?\" I think you're supposed to be thinking about how it works."

How are we gonna have income coming in the door? And how are we gonna have that income be larger than our expenses?\" And that's a whole another job with a whole another focus. And so, I don't expect a business person to know or care about exactly what a technical person is knowing or caring about. And so, at this... And this is, again, my little world. I often work in software, so these are the two... These are the big parties in the world I'm talking about, but the same thing can be said for editing. A publication, you have writers, you have editors, you have advertisers, you have the same kinds of different people. And I feel like all these other careers have their focus, and their focus is clear."

    timestamp: "22:41"
    speaker: Andy
    content: "And then, design, I honestly feel like the job of design is to be the one group that listens to all of the groups and understands more of where they're coming from, to play a bridge. Because if you don't have that role, then all design is either gonna do it at the end of the day, \"Well, the business people decided how it's gonna be, how the subscription's gonna work, and how it's gonna be sold, and what the price is gonna be, and how many people we can afford to hire. And the engineers have decided what features are reasonable to build, and they've done all their AB testing and research, and they've figured out exactly what the thing has to do.\""

I'm gonna try and make sure that the business things are represented in the design, and the technical things are represented in the design. I'm gonna smooth out all these corners and bridge these gaps. And when that's your job, when you're the fixer, the little in-between-the-space job, it's hard to feel like you really have a place, and that you have a sphere that is your own. And that's something I've been feeling, which I feel like it relates more abstractly than just in my specific situation, but maybe I'm wrong. So to Victoria or Kara, somebody who's working at a different specific industry, do you have this sense of how your practice relates to the other practices going on in your respective companies, and how that affects your sense of yourself and what your job is?

And so, I think I understood what my role was, and I knew that I was just a piece of it. And I knew that I had to do my job to the best of my ability, and I needed to do it with a lot of thoughtfulness because I knew that if I messed up my piece, that's gonna make somebody else within the organization's job harder, and that turns into a domino effect."

I had to make smart and thoughtful decisions constantly because that affected this whole entire organization. And I think there were probably maybe more existential feelings of being me making type choices. Those decisions probably didn't really seem to matter as much as to maybe some of my coworkers who were organizers on the ground. And so, I think I feel that role, and not in an intimidating way, but more of like I felt confident in the responsibility that I had in that role. Did I go to a totally bizarre direction? I don't know if that answered that question."

    timestamp: "26:58"
    speaker: Andy
    content: "Yeah, I think your answer, which was great, really highlighted the fact that maybe the issue I'm only having is that as a small company that works with other small companies, we don't have such carefully-defined roles on any project. Working in a big organization, that kind of oversight is necessary. Or if things are to get done, and if people don't know it's getting done, you have to have very specific... People doing very specific things, otherwise, it's hard to be responsible for everything. And so, it could be as simple as like... My main issue right now could be as simple as just working in small companies, you don't have the benefit of that bureaucracy, that kind of structure. And therefore, you end up having to eke out your own space when it might not be one naturally there for you. Do you feel this way, Matt? 'Cause Matt, we're at similar companies now doing very similar things. Do you have this feeling? "
  -
    timestamp: "27:50"
    speaker: Matt
    content: "Absolutely! I think it's the feeling of what you said of making your own space. It's not always clear when we start a new job exactly what I'm supposed to be doing sometimes. Yes, maybe we're designing and building a product, or designing and building a website, or something like that. And of course, that will need a designer of some sort. But sometimes, it's pretty open-ended at the beginning, and maybe it's even pretty open-ended as to like, \"Who's providing you feedback? And who's giving you this?\" And I think, sometimes, that lack of clarity, of course, that's why you're being hired. But also, that can make it hard to know if you've done a good job to know if you're managing it well."
  -
    timestamp: "28:33"
    speaker: Matt
    content: "And the fact that it's small teams, we don't necessarily always have a dedicated person to be project manager. That usually just falls to either me or potentially a developer who's leading the project. So it's not always super clear who's in charge, and who's responsible for telling you that you did well and you could move on. So when that's not clear, you have to do it for yourself. And if you're not so good at praising yourself, it's probably pretty hard to feel like you've always done a great job. And I've also been in the situation where I've had less control, and all I wanted was more control. So I don't think it's a bad thing, necessarily; it's just once you have that kinda control over it, you're responsible for how you feel about it."

You have to just know that you're doing good, and figure it out,\" which is a... It's a challenging thing, sometimes.

So there's not really a ecosystem of designers where I can figure out where I fit in, \"And here's what I'm good at, and here's my specialty, and here's what people come to me for.\" It's just, \"Well, there's two of us so you come to both of us for everything.\" Something I've noticed, though, is that sometimes, the presence of a more experienced person, like the person you were talking about, Victoria, that is your person that gives you this validation, \"You did the good, you did the bad,\" check, check, plus, whatever. Sometimes, the presence of that person, I think, in the workplace is like an aspirational thing. Like, \"Here's somebody who is doing the thing I'm doing, but they're doing it better 'cause they've been doing it for longer, they're more experienced, or whatever.\" And that gives you something to shoot for and gives you a goal, which is really helpful, I think."

Sometimes, having that person, I think, in a workplace, from things I've observed in our own workplace and others, gives people this sense of always being behind. So let's say you've got somebody that's been doing this for five years more than you. If you both keep doing your career, that person will have always done it for five years more than you. And so, it's not really a goal in the sense that if you're constantly comparing yourself to this one person or this group of people or whatever, you're never going to get there 'cause you're always gonna be chasing this moving target, which I think is something that, I don't know, something I think about when you consider who's got what skills in different work scenarios, and how you're gonna set those expectations for whose experience, and who's gonna be giving feedback to who, and how that whole system works."

So if we ever get to hire somebody someday that's vastly more experienced than us, that'd be a great privilege to be able to do that. And we haven't had that chance yet. Usually, 'cause people that are smarter than us don't wanna work for idiots, so they go off and do their own thing. So, no, I've always looked outside of my own work environment for those role models to try and aspire to because it's just a different situation.

I think part of it has definitely been triggered by the current world political situation, which has made me a little bit question just on an even bigger sense, the value of my skill set in the grand scheme of things. And Kara, you eluded to this briefly before earlier when you mentioned that some of your co-workers at Hillary for America were maybe on the ground doing organizing with community groups, or doing something that you felt like might be more directly involved, and maybe feel like it's more helpful. I do wonder how much of this is just me looking around and going, \"Sure, maybe I am good at this, but what good is this thing that I'm good at? What can I actually contribute in a bigger sense with these skills that I have?\" Which I think also comes from skepticism of looking at what other designers have done with their skills and being like, \"Is that really helping?\" And then, I have to turn that same sort of critical eye to myself always. Is that a thing that y'all have been thinking about at all? Is this me alone lying awake at night wondering? "

    speaker: Kara
    content: "I think I certainly feel that way 'cause I was somebody that was using my skills to try to stop something from happening, or who was doing a values-driven, on-the-ground job with my design skills. And I spent the last week of the election in North Carolina canvassing, doing a lot of door-to-door stuff, and then helping out at some Democratic field offices. And that, I felt, was a really, really important thing for me to do as a person that had been sitting at an office for six months. Getting that perspective, I think, it made me feel confident in the fact that I was sitting at an office for six months, but it also gave me a perspective that I shouldn't always just sit in an office. And I, of course, had my own intense feelings about the election, and how the design community did or didn't respond during and after."

And also, maybe realizing that sometimes, your sparkly skill set might not be the best way to inflict change in the world, and maybe it's canvassing door-to-door, but I don't know if it's always one or the other. I think it's probably a good combination of both. But then I feel it too, now, as I'm starting a job in media again, that I hope I keep asking those type of questions of how I'm spending my day, and if I'm using my skill set in a way that is needed."

I don't think you go to art school because you're like, \"Well, this offers the clearest, highest return on investment for all of my money I'm gonna sink into my time here.\" People end up studying design or pursuing design largely because it's something they care about and feel drawn to and feel good at, which I think is different than other jobs. I wasn't thinking when I decided to become a designer those many years ago that this would be the way in which I would have the greatest positive impact with my life. That was not the thing that was in the front of my mind. And I think maybe that is what's at the front of doctors or nurses or even lawyers' minds when they're doing their thing. But, yeah, I do think it's important that we not only think of ourselves based on our skill set, and what we bring to our jobs, even though those things might be, perhaps, more important to our self-identity than they are for other people in different jobs."

It's like you're making tools for people to use; doesn't get much more useful than making tools. But I still feel like I could be doing more to help people.

And that was what I set out to do, and so therefore I feel better about myself.\" But something about it being super practical, applicable in the world, and then, thinking about where it could go and how clearly it could improve a process that is good for everyone, that made me feel great."

We did one called \"The Pep Talk Generator,\" which you can go at to our website and have a randomly-generated pep talk for you. [chuckle] And that has been our most successful thing that we've done. We've also done some magazines on self-care. And every once in a while, I'll get an email about one of those projects that are very personal and heartfelt, and I feel like those projects helped that person for whatever reason, whatever day it was. And I feel like those have always been a really good confidence booster because... 'Cause I've been doing Babe Vibes, I think, pretty much by myself. And so, sometimes, it feels very emotional to be the mom of this weird thing that feels pressure-ful. [chuckle] And so, those moments feel like a good confidence booster."

    content: "I thought of one more, which is related, actually, to podcasting, which is not my career at all. We're not even getting money from this is; this is our hobby. But one of the reasons that I like to make podcasts, honestly, the biggest reason is that podcast mean a lot to me, personally. I have had so many hard times in my life that podcasts have gotten me through. And it sounds so dumb to be goofy, comedy podcast that people are just making goofs is gonna be a thing that's gonna help people, but it has really helped me, and it's a thing that means a lot in my life. So, Matt, we'd, a couple years ago now, had a little meetup for one of our previous shows in New York, and just meeting people in New York that had even a shred of a similar relationship with our show that I have at the podcast that have meant so much to me, was a very similar moment where I was like... Made me feel really good about what we were doing because I saw what I valued in the things that I love in people that were listeners to our thing, which meant a lot to me, and I assume to you too, Matt. We've talked about how fun that was."

The things in my life that I have really pursued, and then either gotten to experience or achieved, as soon as you're there, not only is it not as important as you thought it would be, but oftentimes, it's totally disappointing. You're like, \"Wait a minute, this is not at all what I had dreamed it might possibly be.\" And I think it's something that I have to remind myself pretty often is that, it's so easy to take what you currently have for granted, and assume that somebody else's thing, or a different job, or a different place to work would be so much better, a different career would be so much better. But the situations where I've gotten to experience those other things, it's like, \"Well, actually, you know, this is messed up in a whole new cornucopia of ways.\" If you are a doctor, you probably don't get to be the one that gets to cure orphans of diseases. That's probably not a thing that's easy to do, in the same way that if you're doing any kind of job, there's a complex sort of thing going on there. So that's something that..."

I don't listen to other design podcasts for many, many reasons we won't get into here. But it's true, once you get close to something, you become very disillusioned, and it loses a lot of its appeal, and yeah, the fun, public-facing versions of that thing... You think of TV shows that highlight what it's like to be a professional chef, or you think of... Honestly, even great podcasts like Design Matters, the whole thing about that podcast is, \"We're gonna interview people, and we're gonna celebrate their entire thing. We're gonna talk about all the good stuff they've done, none of the bad stuff, and we're gonna be a big celebration about it.\" That portrayal of anything is something that, I think, is hard to remind yourself if it's not your industry, that that is the rose-tinted version of it. We see that when we see design things 'cause we know how the industry works, but whenever we see an episode of Top Chef or whatever, we're like, \"Oh, it'd be so cool to be a chef.\" Not Top Chef, Chef's Table, the one that's about chefs."

And what I want people out there that are listening to this to know is that I don't have, perhaps, as much confidence as maybe you thought. And if anyone wants to talk about it, hit me up on Twitter because I'm happy to discuss these things, which I don't think we discuss enough as an industry. And, yeah, I'm out here having a crisis too, so get at me."

I was thinking a lot about how art school, and then even after that, everyone really loves to be, \"Oh, design can change the world!\" And without any hint of irony at all. It can be productive to keep that mindset because just that reckless self-aggrandizement, it gets you pumped. But I like thinking of, \"Here are the particular little ways that my niche of a field can affect people, and here's all of the ways that it cannot, and everything that it can't do.\" I think that there's power in knowing and stating out loud your limitations, and also in power in specificity.

I think it's good for us to be questioning our role, and whether that means the organizations that we work in, or if it's just the small design choices that we make every single day. I think it's good to grapple existentially with it, and to grapple constantly 'cause I think design is about thoughtfulness. And so, every opportunity to be thoughtful is a good thing."

I can talk on the phone. I don't mind talking to strangers. I have no problem dialing a random number and just talking to people.\" I was like, \"This will help.\" And I totally had one of those... It seems so great, and then you actually do it, and you could become disillusioned because I called... There was one night where I called upwards of 200 phone numbers, and I only spoke to four actual people. And of those four people, three of them were just furious that they had been called again, and just wanted to pick up the phone to yell at the people that called them. And the only one... [chuckle] For one person I talked to, that was like, \"Do you know your voting location?\" And they were like, \"No, I don't think so.\" And I was like, \"It's this church, do you know where that is?\" And they were like, \"I do. Thank you.\" And I was like, \"You know what? Maybe this four-and-a-half hours of calling people was worth it for that one person.\" But it doesn't feel that way. It feels bad."

    content: "And I will say that one of the most visceral moments of the entire campaign for me was the night I went and phone banked at one of the locations. I don't know what it is. It's a DNC look office, or something. It was an office in the city where I went. And there was a bunch of other people there, probably 30 or 40 other people. And it was shocking to me to see who cared enough to come out to phone bank because I was the only white man, first of all, of all 30 or 40 people, and it was mostly all retired ladies who were like, \"Yep, I'm gonna go call some people because this is something that means a lot to me.\" And it was very visceral to me to see the people that cared enough to come out and do that. So that was a beneficial experience in perhaps a different way than calling all those phone numbers and getting yelled at by those people. But that's something I can do, I get yelled at, and I don't get upset about it, so that's my contribution. Well, I think that's the end of the podcast; I think we made one."
