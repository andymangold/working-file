It's the end of summer, people are traveling, they're on vacation, scheduling is impossible. So instead of our typical three to four person panel show, it's instead a one on one conversation with myself and Linda. We actually recorded this back in March so some of the references might be a little bit dated but I hope you enjoy it nonetheless, we'll be back in two weeks with a typical episode for you. Thank you for your understanding."

And there's all of this conversation happening right now around working with these 20 somethings. I don't know, a lot of it resonated with me because I felt like I've experienced or seen a lot of those problems in the workplace."

    content: "So this TED Talk with legs, his perspective was that millennials are a generation that were raised being told they were the greatest, they could accomplish anything and they were all given participation trophies and therefore they want everything immediately they don't want to have to work for it. And now they've hit the work place, they are shocked and there is a huge cultural divide because they are not getting rewarded the way they want get rewarded and they feel a sense of ennui about their work. Is this something that you feel more Linda? Or is this something you feel you've seen in other people? Or both? "

    timestamp: "02:32"
    speaker: Linda
    content: "Well both. It sucks because I definitely feel... I think the main point of what he's talking about isn't just the fact that everybody wants cool bean bags and water slides in their office, which is super freaking annoying, but they also just want this sense of purpose. There's like the Maslow's hierarchy of needs that I think people are reaching the top of that pyramid a lot sooner in life because all of their basics needs are being met in first world America at a really young age. So, then you have 22 year olds looking for their life's purpose in their first job. And they want to make a huge impact on the world, and they want to start movements and change everything, but they want do it in the first six months because instant gratification is such a thing now and nobody has the patience to just work hard and put in the effort for years and years and years. That's something that I feel in myself a little bit too, to just look around every couple of months and be like, \"What have we actually done here? Have we even moved the needle at all?\". [chuckle]"

    speaker: Linda
    content: "And yeah. I guess I just wanted to pick your brain about that little bit 'cause I am really curious about how you structure your office. And how you give people their sense of purpose or do you just tell them, \"You shut up kids. You don't get to have purpose here.\""

    speaker: Andy
    content: "So it's kind of a cop out. I don't do a ton at the office, at the studio to set purpose or to try and inspire purpose. We're a consulting company which is on its worse day is extremely unglamorous. Somebody else comes in the door with the purpose, and you're supposed to assume their purpose and hop aboard the train and do your best to kind of see their vision out as best you can give your skills and perspective. So, we don't work for morally bankrupt companies. You know we were contacted once by a very high end shooting range that wants to let people come in and rent AR-15s and M16s to shoot at these targets and it's a very popular shooting range. That was the project we just said, \"No, we don't want to work on that because we feel like it's actually doing bad in the world to celebrate gun culture and make it a fun casual thing you do instead of treating them with the serious things that they are.\""

    speaker: Andy
    content: "So we don't do that kinda stuff but a lot of our projects do not fall in the inspiring world changing impactful sphere. A lot of them are just somebody has an idea for a startup, they've got some funding, and they're gonna build it. Or somebody has some access to some products, they want to build online stores to sell those products to people that have excess income to buy these products that don't actually really do anything practically in the world. So, a lot of it is that and so it's hard to, I think approach that kind of work with the inspiring vision setting that Simon describes all millennials seeking."

    content: "What I will say for, myself is that I don't think about that our impact strictly in terms of the design and development work that we do, even though that's what the company does on the face of it. I think about our impact as also being a nice place to work where people can have a good living and have good health insurance cover them and have a work place that will allow them to take time off with their kids and just be a healthy workplace that makes people happy. And I feel like in some small way if I can look at our few employees and say, \"Well here's some people that otherwise might not have a job this good.\" That's all the good that I need to do in the world to feel okay about my contribution. And if we do that by building some website to sell widgets to people then what's the damage. It's kind of my feeling of the whole thing."

    timestamp: "06:39"
    speaker: Linda
    content: "And one thing that the video talks about is that it's just difficult to keep these people employed because of the short attention span and I feel like right now the economy is doing pretty well for designers and that there's like everywhere I look I feel like I see somebody who needs a designer and can afford to pay one to do things. Have you found it difficult?"

    content: "But no they needed their pamphlets to... You know, not the most exciting work. And I was like, \"I'll do anything to get this job.\" But I still didn't get those jobs because of how bad the economy was at the time. And right now it just seems like it's not nearly as bad as it was 12 years ago."

    timestamp: "08:01"
    speaker: Andy
    content: "I hope it's not as bad as it was in 2008 certainly. And I didn't graduate till 2011 and frankly I never actually tried to get a real job so I can't speak on this at all. But I will say that I don't think, anecdotally if I'm talking to my peers and people in the world, I don't think right now it's like there is such an abundance of great jobs that there's too many to go around. I feel like there's still plenty of people out there that are really looking for something that is going to suit their skills and suit them. Maybe that's to your and Simon's point though that all these people feel like none of these jobs that maybe are out there or jobs they may have had are giving them the kind of fulfillment that they're seeking."

    content: "We've hired a lot of people and something we had to be very clear about in the interview process every time was, \"By the way, we're not looking to hire somebody for eight months so they can then jump onto another job. There is some amount of getting to know the company, some amount of getting in the flow of things. And we're also looking for people that wanna be a dedicated member of the team for long term.\" And a lot of people just walked out the door when we said that, they're like \"Oh, I don't want a job for that long. It's not even on the table for me.\" Because it's so common to jump from job to job every year or two years for people that are our age."

    content: "And something that I want to be careful of is I think that one of the flaws of Simon's argument is that he has a very rosy view of the past. He seems to imply that because we're jumping from job to job that is inherently worse then our parents generation or our grandparents generation that work for the same company for their entire life until they retired, 40 years or whatever. I don't want to assume that that's better and I'm curious to know if you think that the kind of rapid movement... 'Cause full transparency I graduated six years ago and started a company and have been doing that ever since. You have worked for tons of companies..."

    timestamp: "10:50"

I would love to be that committed to my own work someday, where maybe if I do start my own studio or something like that I could see myself staying that committed to it, where it's kind of your own thing. But this idea of working for a corporate conglomerate type thing for decades and decades is just mind boggling to me. And then at the same..."

    timestamp: "11:52"
    speaker: Andy
    content: "Well I'm glad you said that because I do wanna point out that I think there is a big difference in that in the kinds of jobs that you and I would have, right? The kinds of people that would hire us for our skill sets and many other designers out there for their skill sets are not companies that have been around for 50 years and will be around for other 50, right?

And, it just kind of circumstance that the things that we're interested in doing happen to be companies that are less reliable. They're popping up, they're going out of business, they're being bought, they're getting funding and starting up again. It's just a lot of churn."
  -
    timestamp: "13:45"
    speaker: Linda
    content: "Exactly. But, I will say that I have found a lot of joy in putting in that time with companies. I know, it seems like maybe I haven't worked in places very long because I have worked at so many companies. But, at MailChimp... I was there for like almost three years and I feel like... It's like the first six months to a year was just kind of getting comfortable there. And getting to know everyone, getting to know the brand."

    content: "And we talked about this here at Ueno a lot where, like the first couple of weeks that you're on a project with a brand new design team, you can basically just throw that time away. Speaking purely candidly, I do not tend to do my very best work in the first two weeks of having that job. Because..."

    timestamp: "14:34"
    speaker: Linda
    content: "Signing a contract for a job is such a big commitment. And I think it takes so much time to get really comfortable with everybody and all of these new things that it takes a couple of months to get a really good working flow going and figuring out even who in the company you do your best work with. And then, once you figure those things out, and you have to figure it out by failing, by the way, which is a thing that a lot of people are not comfortable with. But then, you get to this point where you could just kind of iterate on that process and make it better and better. And that's where the real magic starts to happen for me. So, I feel like if I had quit within that first year at MailChimp when things where uncomfortable and you're trying to work with a few people and things aren't quite gelling right. If I had just taken those negative feelings that I had from that and accepted defeat, I wouldn't be anywhere close to where I am today. And I'm so glad that I kinda hung in there because it took some time but, it definitely paid off. And I think that that's what's happening. There are these feelings of awkwardness that has sprout up in those first one to 11 months."

And they're like, \"Well, I'm gonna go somewhere else and I'm gonna find that feeling.\" At least, that's what it seems like to me. And I think that you're just gonna have to hang in there and keep pushing and working hard. Eventually, hopefully, you'll find the ways that you can contribute to that company or else you move on. I don't know."

    timestamp: "16:23"
    speaker: Andy
    content: "Yeah, I feel like it's really cliche to say like, \"Uh, there's no such thing as fair\", but there is kind of what it comes down to ? Maybe a less cliche way to put it is just that, if you are focused on fair, you will only ever be concerned about how unfair everything is."

I just witnessed it the other day where an older woman and I were both headed towards a long bathroom line but from completely different areas and space.

The bathroom line is just one example but it happens all the time in driving, in waiting in the checkout lane at the grocery store, you just suddenly see these nasty little parts of people's personalities where they can't wait to be ahead of you because they feel like they deserve it for some reason and that is not just people our age, that is every single person no matter who [chuckle] they are."
  -
    timestamp: "18:33"
    speaker: Andy
    content: "This is something that I have to constantly remind myself too because I'm a big over-thinker and so my natural tendency is to ruminate on all the hard work I've done in X situation and how [chuckle] that has not been reciprocated fairly. And what really taught me was frankly doing consulting work. We've been consulting for six years now, as I've said a couple times. I think it's generally accepted in a model like that where someone's paying you a lot of money to do something for them that the \"customer's always right\" thing applies. We're being hired, we're being paid by them, so if they are gonna not respond to our emails for three weeks and they're gonna be short with us for whatever reason, we just have to kinda smile and take it, which I don't entirely agree with but what I will say is that has over time really taught me this lesson of give up on fairness because I've learned that if you just sit there and go, \"Well, we keep responding immediately and they take forever to respond,\" or \"we spend all this time answering their questions and then we ask them a few questions and they don't even answer them clearly,\" and you get mad about those things. You're not being productive at all. [chuckle] You're accomplishing nothing."

    content: "And so many times when I've just taken the time to push back all those thoughts and defensive thoughts of being right and being fair and wanting to justify my position and I push all that back and just say alright let's ignore that and get down to solving the problem at hand, the outcome is always so much better. So the other thing I mentioned in my little talk was that I think people oftentimes lack empathy in teamwork scenarios and certain relationships. People for the most part will at least try to empathize with people like their family or their loved ones but people very rarely try to do that with coworkers, with clients, with bosses, with employees, with whoever. And the example I gave which is my little kind of dark little sick twisted trick to keep me honest when I'm dealing with people is that I always imagine the person I'm dealing with has just had the worst day of their entire life."

Just imagine it's the worst day of their life and if how you treat them is not okay in that scenario, it's never okay to treat somebody that way. It's like..."

Statistically, it's not very often the worst day of your life but if you treat people that way it's a great shortcut to just... Maybe you don't actually have the empathy, you can't imagine what it might be like to be in their shoes but just treat them as if you accept that that's difficult whatever it is they're doing. And if you do that, you're gonna be much better at your job. You're a much better collaborator if you treat people with that kind of respect."

But lately, it's kind of been the other way around where I'm the art director and I'm hiring somebody to do something for me and so now I'm the slow one who's taking way too long to get back to people's emails. [chuckle] So now I kind of have this empathy for both sides of the equation. And it actually taught me a lot about myself because when I was the freelancer or the contractor, I'm waiting to get paid and I'm waiting to see if I have work and it would drive me so crazy if it took someone a long time to pay me or if it took them a long time to get back to me with feedback and it kind of messes my own schedule up.

And there's so many different factors at play that you can never predict why somebody is doing what seems like a shitty thing to you, so why sit there and predict? And whenever I have been... I've had a few people working for me where I've taken way too long to get back to them on things because we're either getting a contract together and we're having a hang-up with our lawyer, whatever."

But when somebody responds with that short quick little kind of shitty response, it just makes me like, uh, I know I kinda deserved that but at the same time now it's awkward and now it's not the best working relationship, and yeah.

I have some friends in San Francisco who are just like... I feel like they just could not breathe without their cell phones and I also feel like they see the world through their iPhones and their Instagrams and their stories. It's just constant, like every five minutes, just picking this thing up and trying to capture the perfect representation of the moment that is actually being lived in real life right in front of their eyes. It's starting to drive me crazy and I think that I've spent a lot of my life being that person and that's why it's so maddening to me. So I'm not saying that I'm perfect by any means, but yeah, I think that people just don't even know how to make eye contact with other people because of it and we're all just suffering in our real relationships because of the relationships that we have with our phone. I've been in bed with my partner before and if they pick their phone up, I'm like, \"Uh-uh, uh-uh, no, no, no, no, no, no.\" I'm like, \"You hug me before you hug your little iPhone please.\" [chuckle]"

No, no, hug me first because I'm the living and breathing human being who's in bed with you, that's such a big and serious thing. And even on New Year's this year I made a point to leave my phone in the other room where I couldn't get to it 'cause we were all outside in the mountains and it was snowing and it was so much fun and we were throwing axes at trees and stuff, not the safest thing. I looked around and everybody's experiencing the moment of the new year when we counted down to one with their phone right up to their faces, and I don't know about you but I actually would be interested to hear your opinion on this. But I don't remember any of the times that I've spent inside my phone. When I look at that thing, I get so lost in it and you can't get my attention at all, I mean maybe a little bit, but the problem is that I don't actually have any memories of what I'm doing in there, you know?"

I agree that it is a little bit scary, the rate at which social media specifically, but just having a device on you all the time, having access to the internet all the time, I'm a little shocked and I think it's a little bit alarming just how fast that has changed the social dynamics in the world in our generation. That is certainly an alarming thing, just in a sense that we are definitely in new unexplored territory, right? We don't really know what it's like to grow up entirely living your life through a device. You don't really know if its good or bad or how it affects things like memories you've created versus not created, and in that sense I do kinda feel like we're all guinea pigs. [chuckle] It's not like Apple was like, \"We're gonna play this big experiment on people,\" there was no intent behind it, no maliciousness, but I do feel like we are in a space where we're trying to figure out what that means."

I think social media is amazing. I think it's incredible. I don't think it's any surprise that people want to be on their phones for a large part of the day because how amazing is it to be able to be connected across the entire globe with people that share your values, share your priorities in ways that maybe the people that happen to be in the same geographic space as you just don't share, right? And this applies to everything from Twitter to people that love their little subreddits or people that have Slack teams of certain groups of people over parts of the subject.

Those conversations are not gonna be beneficial to either of us, therefore we don't talk about those things, we just deduce stuff, we just go tubing because that's a thing you can do with someone in the same geographic space, but when we're tubing we're not necessarily talking about whatever, deep life stuff, because that's not the sort of grounds of our relationship. And I have other friends, like you Linda, that I've never met, that I just know from across the country or across the world that maybe I met them once or twice and we really clicked and now we have this online relationship and I feel like older people are always looking down on that as if it's lesser than."

I have nieces and nephews all in that age rage and it's really interesting to watch how they are adopting technology because all of the same social dynamics that we grew up with in elementary school, middle school, high school when we didn't have these devices are still present.

And I follow him on Instagram and it's hilarious following young kids on Instagram because they post all the emojis and hashtags but seeing him and all his teammates all be on Instagram celebrating this journey through their little kiddie playoffs or whatever was amazing. It's the kind of thing that I remember how fun that was as a kid to be in your little soccer playoffs or whatever and to have artifacts from that and to be able to celebrate those moments and capture them is a real thing. I don't think that people are on Instagram and Twitter and Snapchat wasting their lives because it's a dopamine hit as Simon seems to think.

Instead, we grew up with this tendency to try things out and to try on different personas almost. I think that like for me it would be like I'd go to church on Sundays and I would be one person on those days where I was expected to act and behave a certain way and then on Tuesdays there was a thing that I had to go to that I knew a bunch of punk kids would be there and so I'd be more of like a punk kid and I'd try to skateboard and stuff."

And contrary to what you said, I actually have very precise memories of certain e-mails I've gotten or certain times that I've logged on and seen something for the first time.

    content: "Oh absolutely. Same thing goes, and this is kind of grim, but the same thing goes for tragedies and stuff. Like I remember the night that the earthquake and subsequent tsunami hit Japan, whatever like seven years ago or something, which was shortly after I joined Twitter. I remember being amazed at how amazing a news resource this thing was. It was one of the first times I experienced a national event through Twitter and I remember so vividly the feeling of going through the timeline and of trying to follow threads and that kind of stuff. So I do feel like I'm forming memories and stuff that are very integral with the technology that I'm experiencing them through."

Does it like paint a picture very vividly of certain moments, sometimes. But I don't feel my memories any different depending on the context that something happened in, just wasn't important to me. And if it was then I remember it and if it wasn't then I probably don't. And sometimes important stuff happens on a phone. I remember specific road trips where I was texting one person for hours and hours on end because we were just really deep in some important conversation and talking about something."

I do love technology and I do love that world so much but I think that you just have to learn how to be really careful with it because the real life that is happening around you outside of these rectangles is ultimately what I'm striving for and what's more important. And so I think it's just giving precedence to the living and breathing things that are around me when they are around me and then saving the little rectangles for a little rectangle time. [chuckle]"

And for texting people nonstop, like just today my best friend who moved to New York I felt like... I realized I haven't seen her in months but I don't feel like it at all because we'll just text each other non-stop and she's airing all of her grievances about different things to me and you're able to still be there for friends who are physically so far away."

So, yes there's huge importance to it but I think it's just like people when you're living and breathing humans are around you like put your fucking phone down.

    content: "A good example is some people watch TV by just turning on the TV and whatever is on they're gonna watch and it's very easy just to kind of get into that rut, that little habit of \"I'm gonna watch a thing and it's gonna take my attention away and that'd be great.\" Some people watch TV by seeking out television shows they really like and watching them intensely and paying attention and then getting on the internet and talking to other fans about it, sharing in the experience of a new tv show coming out, which is another thing I resented about Simon's little rant was that he said that, \"Oh, some people wait to binge watch an entire thing because they want immediate gratification.\""

I knew people in high school and college that went to all the parties and never meaningfully engaged with anybody, any of them, because they were just there kinda going through the routine. I think you can do on auto pilot, and you can do anything with purpose and with intent and, that to me is the distinguishing factor, not the medium. And whether or not it's slightly easier to go on auto pilot on a device than it is in real life, it's probably true, there's probably some weight to that but..."

And then you enjoy it so much more, like it feels like a little gift that you're giving yourself. And it's the same thing with your phone, and your iPad and whatever. It's like, all right, this is the time that I'm spending to do this thing, because I want to, and not because I'm accidentally going to fall into it and be like, \"Whoa, what happened to the last four hours? Didn't mean to watch The Kardashians.\""

    content: "Every generation is like arbitrary, arbitrary grouping of people based on whatever. Some generations are much more concrete. You think about the baby boomers, where it was... There really was a spike in population when this group of people came back from the war, and they were all raised under a very specific context and a certain political climate and, yeah, it was an immense variation, infinite variation, but there was still this constant thread."

    content: "And then from there I think like every generation is like, \"Well, our defining feature is that, we were raised by the baby boomers. And our defining gener... \" And it's like, well, we don't really have the same defining thing. If there's anything for our generation, I think it is gonna be the coming of age and coming of adulthood with access to social media and the internet, which I really do think has a huge effect on people. I think it's almost entirely positive, which is kinda contrary to what Simon thinks. But, I always think about, what it must be like to be in a small town in the Midwest, and you are one of the only gay people in that town, and you're growing up as a kid. And how difficult that must have been, how near impossible it must have been 30 years ago..."

And how much better things must be, certainly not all good..."
