    content: "Basically, exactly five years ago that we recorded the first episode of what will become our... Well, at least, the three of our first podcasts. I know, Matt, you had a podcast before that, but the first podcast we did together called On The Grid. And On The Grid ran for 120 some episodes, and was kind of the spiritual precursor to this show and... But unfortunately, we lost Dan in the transition, so we decided to have him back on for a nice reunion show, and here he is."

    speaker: Dan
    content: "It's been exceptionally balanced, that's it. It's not even exciting. I spend my free time at home exercising and sleeping, so it's really... There's nothing new to it, there's nothing special, but it has been very nice to not have side projects or anything like that that I do."

    speaker: Andy
    content: "Dreamcast was forever my aspirational consoles. The one I always wanted and never got just because I didn't need it at all, but it seemed so cool, a little screen in the controller, that was progressive and forward thinking."

    speaker: Matt
    content: "Yeah."
  -
    timestamp: "05:36"
    speaker: Dan

  -
    timestamp: "05:43"
    speaker: Andy
    content: "Well, the closest thing is that doesn't Nintendo have a whole controller, it's also a Game Boy basically? "
  -
    timestamp: "05:48"
    speaker: Dan
    content: "Yeah. I mean it's basically a tablet with the controls on the side."
  -
    timestamp: "05:52"
    speaker: Andy
    content: "Yeah. That seems pretty close."
  -
    timestamp: "05:54"
    speaker: Dan
    content: "Yeah. It's really cool."
  -
    timestamp: "05:55"
    speaker: Andy
    content: "So, I think we should talk about design things even though, that's not really in the spirit of On The Grid."
  -
    content: Chuckle
  -
    timestamp: "06:05"
    speaker: Matt
    content: "Well, we just have to pretend that we're talking about design things and then we just talk about anything. This is not to the spirit of it."
  -
    timestamp: "06:09"
    speaker: Andy
    content: "There's a couple loose ends I want to tie up though because I know that the die-hard listeners out there that had followed us from podcast to podcast just need to know, they gotta figure it out. I gotta know Dan, how many jobs have you had since we stopped recording On The Grid? "

  -
    timestamp: "06:32"
    speaker: Dan
    content: "I think... Okay, I have to think about timelines. So when I left the show, after that, a few months later I went to go work at another startup. Surprise. Surprise. But I was only there for six months, it just wasn't a good fit."
  -
    timestamp: "06:46"
    speaker: Andy
    content: "Sounds about right."
  -
    timestamp: "06:48"
    speaker: Dan
    content: "Yeah, but afterwards I returned back to CBS Interactive and I've been incredibly happy being back."

    content: "Great."

    timestamp: "06:54"
    speaker: Dan
    content: "Yeah, that's it. So again..."
  -
    timestamp: "06:56"
    speaker: Andy
    content: "So really only one other job 'cause you're not gonna... You can't go back to the same place."
  -
    timestamp: "07:00"
    speaker: Dan
    content: "No, no. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And it was very convenient because I left for about six months almost to a day and then when I left, they still had my position open so it was... I was very fortunate but..."
  -
    timestamp: "07:13"
    speaker: Matt
    content: "They realized they couldn't live without you."
  -
    timestamp: "07:16"
    speaker: Dan
    content: "Yeah. They sure did. So yeah, yeah, again very anti-climatic but back at CBS, I'm super happy and working on really, really big projects so I could stay busy."
  -
    timestamp: "07:29"
    speaker: Andy
    content: "Great. So we did talk a little bit about what topics we would cover. Which I gotta say, again, not on the spirit of On The Grid, clearly we've fallen off our game 'cause we had to talk about topics ahead of time. But, Matt, I think you brought up the idea of just how our perspective on our careers has changed given that we started the podcast five years ago which doesn't seem like that much time but that was for all of us more than half our careers ago. So we're in very different places now than we were then. It's my birthday."
  -
    timestamp: "08:00"
    speaker: Matt
    content: "Even a significant portion of our lives. We're not that old."
  -
    timestamp: "08:02"
    speaker: Andy
    content: "Yeah, no, exactly. It's my birthday in two days so I'm almost 29 now, which is one away from 30. So we're getting up there and I think that we kind of like... I think we should make this a nice Bildungsroman, a coming-of-age podcast, [Chuckle] and just talk about... 'Cause we've known each other for a long time and we've been doing this for a long time and this is a good opportunity I think to revisit some of the big takeaways from the past five years."
  -
    timestamp: "08:28"
    speaker: Matt
    content: "And I think the way I phrase this specifically was, what are the things you used to worry about? And what are the things you worry about now? 'Cause that's my life. It's just hopping from one worry to the next worry and then realizing that and then be like, \"Well, I'm bored, what else should I worry about?\""
  -
    timestamp: "08:41"
    speaker: Andy
    content: "Okay, let me start. Let me start. Ooh, I have an idea. So I used to worry about graphic design, and now I worry about a mentally unstable president with access to nuclear codes just ending it all."

    timestamp: "09:01"
    speaker: Dan
    content: "Wow."
  -
    timestamp: "09:01"
    speaker: Andy
    content: "I said that flippantly but I do genuinely, you could definitely genuinely track my concerns from over the last five years being almost entirely career-oriented and design-oriented to being very slightly career and design-oriented and much more just world-in-general-oriented. I would say that my scope of concern has broadened, my aperture has only opened over the past five years as I've kind of disengaged from any design community and more engaged with the rest of the world."
  -
    timestamp: "09:36"
    speaker: Dan
    content: "Yeah, there's something interesting there, 'cause I feel the same way. It started out with graphic design and biggest concerns being things like fonts and colors and..."
  -
    timestamp: "09:45"
    speaker: Andy
    content: "Oh yeah, yeah. Oh yeah, that stuff."
  -
    timestamp: "09:47"
    speaker: Dan
    content: "And now, it's not like I've outgrown it, it's more like I just don't care. I've transitioned from that to other things that mean more to me. We're talking about work stuff sure, it's what bigger system level design problems that you have to solve. When it comes to life stuff, I do not do anything design-related when I leave work. I just leave it all where it is at the desk at work and I come home and my biggest concerns are things like paying rent and buying groceries. And that's something that I didn't really care about five or 10 years ago, 'cause I was like, \"Oh yeah, it's just like a normal adult thing,\" but now that's... I don't know. For some reason I'm more present in my mind rather than dumb old design things."
  -
    timestamp: "10:38"
    speaker: Matt
    content: "Wait a minute, that sounds worse. You went from not worrying about rent and groceries to worrying about them all the time."
  -
    timestamp: "10:44"
    speaker: Dan
    content: "Well, I also moved to San Francisco so you can't blame me."
  -
    timestamp: "10:47"
    speaker: Matt
    content: "There you go. That's true, that's true, you quadruple, is it four times, 10 times, 100 times? Is it around $1million a month or something like that?"
  -
    timestamp: "10:55"
    speaker: Andy
    content: "Yeah, give or take."
  -
    timestamp: "10:57"
    speaker: Matt
    content: "Yeah, that's what I figured. I understand how math works. I don't have that at all. I always worry about everything all the time. Just different things, just different work things but even when I'm worried about the entire world, I can't let go of like, \"I hope this thing is on time. Or I hope we can make enough money at work. Or I hope we can continue to survive.\" Andy, do I have to just do it longer? Do the thing that you have been doing for a long time and then you're just like, \"Oh, well, it's fine forever.\" Or is that just... You just get used to dealing with that?"
  -
    timestamp: "11:32"
    speaker: Andy
    content: "Well, I don't know. It might just be a time thing. I will say that weathering some very distinct hardships professionally has given me a sense of resiliency that I did not maybe know was there before my career. It might be a time thing, it might just be different approaches. Did you think, Matt, that you suffer disproportionately from anxiety for an average person? "
  -
    timestamp: "12:00"
    speaker: Matt
    content: "Oh, absolutely. There's no doubt in my mind. Yes."
  -
    timestamp: "12:03"
    speaker: Andy
    content: "Do you feel this affects your quality of life? Or do you think you manage it pretty well? What's your overall relationship with that anxiety? "

    timestamp: "12:09"
    speaker: Matt
    content: "Pick a day. I don't know."

    content: "Today."
  -
    content: Laughter
  -
    timestamp: "12:13"
    speaker: Matt
    content: "Some days, better than others. But I think I'm probably disproportionately affected by anxiety. And it probably hurts my well-being in general, I would say. It'd be weird if it didn't. If I acknowledge that I think I feel it a little bit harder than everybody else and then it doesn't affect my life. I would say it does, for sure."
  -
    timestamp: "12:33"
    speaker: Andy
    content: "And do you think your anxiety has... This is actually a very relevant question. Do you think your anxiety has changed one way or the other since you left Pentagram and effectively started working for a company that you have ownership over to some degree? "
  -
    timestamp: "12:46"
    speaker: Matt
    content: "I don't think so. I feel like it's always been exactly the same and I just find a new threshold. I will worry about a small detail and then I get through that small detail and I'm fine. And then I just worry about the next thing, but in equal amount. It's just a steady thing. I talk about this with my wife Suzy all the time where I'm just, \"Oh, well, I got through that one so I don't worry about it anymore and now I just worry about this new one now, until I get through that and then I'll worry about the next thing.\" Feels more like that."
  -
    timestamp: "13:13"
    speaker: Andy
    content: "So you feel like almost you have to have something to worry about or else there's something terribly wrong? "
  -
    timestamp: "13:20"
    speaker: Matt
    content: "I don't know if I feel like I have to, it just seems like I find the next thing. It's going through a checklist and then you realize, \"Oh, that checklist never ends.\""
  -
    timestamp: "13:29"
    speaker: Andy
    content: "It ends at death."
  -
    timestamp: "13:30"

    content: "Yeah, exactly."
  -
    timestamp: "13:39"

    timestamp: "13:45"
    speaker: Andy
    content: "There's an idea for a new to-do app. Hey, cool new start-up idea. Make a to-do app that just says 'death' at the bottom. Always looming there."
  -
    timestamp: "13:50"

It almost sounds like a chore a lot of times when people discuss this sort of thing, like a hobby or whatever.

I think it's a commitment to continue to make this podcast and to find guests every week. If I was gonna... Well, no, that's a bad example. I was gonna say if I was gonna die next month, I would stop doing it, but I wouldn't. I would definitely get the last podcast episodes out, but it's not like what I would do with my free time in a vacuum, right? Same goes for gardening actually, I mean planting a garden is fun and it's very rewarding, but it's also an enormous responsibility.

But I've very much obligated myself to that. I don't have the option to quit the garden unless I want my backyard to totally fall part and all of my neighbors send me angry emails. And then there's the hobbies, or really in my case, hobby, which is car games [Chuckle] which are the thing I would do in a vacuum given no other stimuli, that would occupy my entire... All of my free brain cycles would just be thinking about games, basically, if I had the freedom to do so."

Do you feel like you're more balanced or do you look back five or 10 years ago, those were the simpler times?"

    content: "I don't know if I look at them as the simpler times. I mean I know there's a lot of things that are hard now, but I wouldn't wanna go back and be like, have to face all those things again. The thing I mentioned of these hurdles of worry or stress or whatever, it wasn't any less real at the time, right? Doing a thing I would consider not to be an issue now, if I had to do it again and be in the same place, it would be just as painful or stressful or whatever.

You basically have the same baseline level of anxiety, joy, sadness, whatever, no matter what's going on in your life because you're kind of calibrated for that. And, you know, even if your career now was 40% better in all ways than it was four years ago or five years ago, like you said, Matt, the things you're worrying about then you still would have worried about then and you're just gonna find new things to worry about now.

I felt like I was getting very apparently older every day, and that age was like this terrible thing and it was awful. And now, I actually feel much younger than I did then, and just have a much greater optimism about things. I'm 31 now and I actually feel younger in spirit than I did when I was 25.

And so I would feel like, \"Oh, my God, if this thing isn't gonna work and if this thing isn't gonna work, it's all gonna fall apart and this project is gonna be ruined and all that.\" And now, if something doesn't work out as intended or the stuff that we planned, I'm fine. We just wing it and that seems totally reasonable and it's also like, \"Well, it is a totally reasonable setup or mindset.\" So, I think that was just like a level of growing up, and to Matt's point, almost, it's like you're ramping up the amount of things that you have a tolerance for.

And she's done a bit of freelance work. She is pretty familiar with the whole concept of designing for interfaces and all that. She's really green. She's new to it. And just listening to the stuff that she thinks about, how she thinks about it, her process, how her mind just wraps around problems, it feels barely, barely familiar like I was there 10 years ago but it feels so foreign now. And it's like when we talk about our own experiences I kinda feel like it's a bit deluded because it's mixing in how we feel now and just trying to remember where we were back then."

We put account info over here, I have concerns about this icon, of the placement.\" I'm just like, \"Man if it works, just do it.\" 'Cause there's that page but then all these other things. And just the way that we talk about it and the language around it, that was very eye-opening to me and it was funny for me think, because we were talking about topics last night and to know that we were gonna talk about it later, I was like, \"Oh yeah.\" This for me, internally, is perfect because I feel like I have a better perspective on just a career of 10 years and how far all of us have gotten but how hard it is to actually have a decent perspective on it."

That might be the thing that you're really good at, which is also really valuable. I could imagine that would be a thing, I don't know.

Unless your definition of success is, \"I get to do whatever I want and think I'm cool,\" then I guess you could do that no matter what but I really feel like... I also think this extends beyond just a person. You can also say that a well-designed product does not guarantee it will be successful. A good anything is not necessarily gonna be the successful version of something and what it comes down to for me is I feel regardless of whether or not you work at a company or you are a freelancer or you're a contractor, whatever. I think being reliable and being easy to work with are six times more important than being skilled at the thing you're doing. I think there's a lot of room for being just fine at the thing you're doing or mediocre if you are reliable and easy to work with over somebody that is maybe extremely skilled but not reliable and not easy to work with."

The other thing that comes up here and this doesn't necessarily apply inside of companies as much in a normal career but if you're making anything that is gonna be consumed by people, the way you promote yourself is way more important than the thing you're making or what you are. Good promotion always makes up for a lackluster product regardless of whatever it is. And I might've felt this way cynically when I was younger like, \"Oh man, all those bad stuff gets popular because of dumb promotions.\" I think I've just kind of accepted it at this point and kind of recognized that it's just a part of what you have to do if you are trying to make things in the world."

I don't know, the things that bore me are the ones that are like that people started telling the same jokes over and over again, that's not as fun. And then the other... It's either communities are just... They're interesting 'cause they're not design-based they just have maybe designers, that's one thing. Or they're just like boring cliche things people say over and over again. That stinks."

This is not like a professional forum between designers discussing all design things all the time and it's kept very professional and very strict and all that. It's just not that, it's just people who have a common ground, they're discussing topics that they enjoy talking about. So it doesn't feel like this is a design community thing, it just feels like some well-respected, very nice people that are just talking over a mic."

Which is we do come in with the topic every week that is related to design at least. I mean pretty directly. It's not... Hasn't been any real far-fetched episodes yet. And the reason that I want to make Working File, the podcast, is because of the kind of outpouring of great feedback we got about how people felt like On The Grid helped them through their careers in spite of us cracking jokes [Chuckle] basically."

I wish that we were famous enough and charming enough to basically have a personality podcast of the successful, we could just like, be ourselves and just talk about whatever. 'Cause that's the kind of thing that I like most in the world. But I think that I wanna make Working File, this show, because I think that us and our contributors have something valuable to share with people and there are conversations that are worth having that are not happening elsewhere. So, I'm actually more on Matt's side like, I do want this show to become a thing that resembles design community or at least addresses it a little bit."

    timestamp: "41:58"
    speaker: Andy
    content: "But yeah, I mean we started On The Grid, I did not feel this way. I mean, I was, again, kind of sarcastic, but I was on Dribbble. I was on Designer News. It didn't exist yet, but I was on Designer News when it came out. I was one of the first users. I was following all of the designers on Twitter. I was in those communities at that time. All the design blogs. Everything like that, and now I'm just not at all. And I think we've talked about it before. I feel like it was a phase I had to go through in my career and now I feel like there's not much value left there for me, which is partially a criticism of those places, and partially just recognizing that I've kind of moved on in my career and design practice. But, Matt, I do think that there is a contrast, 'cause I'm part of many online communities for many other things that I do find very valuable. So..."

    timestamp: "42:58"
    speaker: Andy
    content: "That's part of it, but I think there's something to be said for the fact that the connective tissue, the only things... A community is defined by what does people have in common. Every person in a community is their own fully formed individual with their own disparate interests, but the thing that connects everybody's, whatever their sort of shared things are, and frankly, I just think, in the design community, the thing that is shared amongst the most people is just a very shallow thing. It is not a deep thing. It is not a meaningful thing. It is not a way of thinking about the world. It is not a methodology or philosophy. It is just, \"Oh. You just made stuff on the computer, graphics-wise.\" That's basically the thing we all share. Therefore that's the defining feature of it. And I don't think that the sub-cultures... Like we are part of a certain sub-culture, design people, that really are still on Dribbble. They are still a very vibrant community on Dribbble. That's a whole different sub-culture that's unto itself."

    content: "There's probably something to be said for all kinds of other web places that are similar. I just don't think the sub-cultures have solidified enough in a lot of circumstances for one to be appealing to me. Obviously, if I could talk with like-minded people, as we do every week on the show, about things I care about, about systems, about how small decisions can affect things at scale when you're working in a broader context. Those things, I'm deeply interested in. I would love to have a community of people that all cared about a pattern language, and design, and all the things that interest me. It's just that that's not the design community. The design community is people that happen to have Photoshop in their machines when they were in high school. Pretty much."

    timestamp: "44:41"
    speaker: Matt
    content: "I have to say, I had a very similar thing happen to me in high school, which was being in a metal band and then realizing that the connection shared amongst the greater group was kind of boring, especially when you got older. We were all like, we're all just really angry and we like these bands. But there are plenty of people I met that came out of that that were fantastic and wonderful and I still love today. But I think a lot of those people got very bored of this shallow connection that everybody shared. I think a lot of things have that. I think you've identified it. It's just this... If the very core of it is this shallow thing, it gets boring and repetitive, but then people spawn little sub-cultures off of that and it gets more interesting and they find deeper meaning in it."

    content: "Yeah, the way it feels to me a lot of times is that when you see these sort of design communities online, it almost feels like the group of co-workers that all agree that they wanna go out for a beer. They get to the bar. They get their beer and then they continue to talk about work. That's the topic that is discussed and there's a level of fatigue about it. And it's almost like we can't talk about anything else. I get that we're co-workers, but can we just talk about a different subject other than that thing? And it feels like designers leech onto the tropes and just continue to talk about that over and over and over again, rather than... That's kind of the point I was trying to make with this show and especially with On The Grid, is that that wasn't really the case. It doesn't feel like you guys are getting back from work and just talking about work all over again. You just got done with eight hours and you're gonna clock two more. It actually feel more like intellectual discourse. And something that's more interesting and more compelling and much more broader than the pixels that you worked on that day."

Whether clients like the work, whether we have enough money coming in the door, all the kind of practical considerations. Totally void of that. Just how I feel about myself is so attached to how I feel about the work I am doing. If I feel like I can't do anything interesting and new, and appropriate, and everything I'm doing is a rip-off or just some kind of re-jumbling of something I saw elsewhere and already liked, I feel bad."

Where I'm not actively thinking about work when I'm picking weeds and listening to a comedy podcast, but I might feel a little bad while I'm doing it, and if I do, it's probably because I didn't like what I did that day."

It's strange and it's bad and then. Oh, it's kind of interesting, and now it's it good again, and then it gets boring and weird and interesting and terrible and good.\" Kind of goes like that.

At the end of the day if it was concluded as that it is more usable, it's more intuitive, people get it, and people like it, then that's perfect for me, and I don't spend a lot of time stressing in between about that, because I think we could try this out. If it doesn't work, we can just roll it back and try something new. So, it doesn't hang with me anymore, which is really, really liberating. So yeah, I don't have that thing. I also don't have that thing where I have to do something new and interesting and special, or unique in any way. I just think about, \"Okay, here's the practical thing that we need to accomplish.

Not only because I know it's detrimental to the work because getting emotionally attached to something that will just end up not meeting the prompt is useless and detrimental, but also it's hard for me to feel invested in that process when it's, \"Well, I know I'm just gonna kind of follow best practices, maybe match some patterns I've known to be successful elsewhere.

That's where I feel like the kind of artistic, for lack of a better word, sense of pride in my work. If I feel like I can't make a stupid contact form look good, I just get so down on myself. I'm like, \"Why can't I make this blog just look nice? It's just a blog. There's been a billion blogs, and I can't make a blog that looks good and fits this particular context.\" And those situations is not really a failure of some practical thing, which I recognize logically is the most important, but it's more an emotional thing of, I still like making stuff with my hands. I like directly manipulating things and trying to make something beautiful, and if I feel like I can't do that, I get real down."

GameSpot, one of two, has been around for 20 years, so people have... It's like trying to balance out giving things that are either long overdue or much appreciated with the other things that are almost... It's a tough love sort of project, like taking this one setting and burying it a little more because at some point it doesn't matter anymore. You get the small group people are gonna be upset and having to almost be callous about it, where you essentially say like, \"I get it.

That's the reward I get, is that when it's easier to work with internally but also it works better for most people outside of us, then that's when I'm like, \"Okay, I can sleep totally fine.\" If everything fell apart and it totally ruined a part of the site and then we have to roll back and there's a whole process to it.

So, you're like, \"Oh man, we could kind of do anything but we can't do anything on this side, on the big project's side.\" On the other side, the exact same thing, but the reverse."
