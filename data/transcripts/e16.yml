It's the worst thing in the world. But I didn't plan on having to build the decks while I was there and I have this old computer that had bad battery life and I was building my decks there, I kept having to be that person who walks into a cafe and be, \"Outlets?

    content: "Tonight, we're gonna be talking about kind of the presence or absence of a weird sensibility in the design world. And Chappell, I actually would like you to explain the roots of this because we're responding to a change in the Bloomberg Businessweek. This is the seed of the conversation. We're not gonna talk about Bloomberg Businessweek the entire time. But we're responding to a change in what appears to be their art direction. And for those people that haven't seen Bloomberg Businessweek before, don't know what we're talking about, how would you describe the change that the magazine has undergone?"
  -
    timestamp: "0:06:11"
    speaker: Chappell
    content: "So, it became at the current state of Bloomberg Businessweek, if you saw it now, it just looks very much so like an average business glossy magazine that would be sitting on a coffee table. I mean, cleaner. A little bit more interesting than maybe TIME Magazine was before it ended. It's not in print anymore, is it? I don't think so."

  -
    timestamp: "0:06:35"
    speaker: Chappell
    content: "Oh, TIME still prints, Newsweek. It's hard to keep up, guys. So, the issue is that for a while, I would say was it three years, maybe, Bloomberg Businessweek kind of underwent this transformation into just kind of letting the creative direction go wild. And I wanna say it was under, was it Richard Turley, I think?"

    timestamp: "0:07:04"
    speaker: Chappell
    content: "And so, I barely know anything. I had to Google everything before this. So anyways, under his direction, Bloomberg Businessweek became pretty outrageous in terms of design, in terms of the context of mainstream magazine design. But it was outrageous enough that it was honestly the only print magazine that I got a subscription to in probably the past decade because it was just weird. It was strange. You would be reading an article on the Chinese stock market and they would have like flying pigs with googly eyeballs and cacti and like the type would be set on squiggles. It was very, very much so out there, in the terms of a lot of mainstream art direction you see."
  -
    timestamp: "0:07:56"
    speaker: Andy
    content: "Do you think it's unfair to say that the art direction was kind of like almost internet aesthetic? I always felt like it looked like the internet more than a print magazine should."

    timestamp: "0:08:17"

  -
    timestamp: "0:08:41"
    speaker: Chappell
    content: "Yeah, so it was clearly they were breaking the rules in a way, but what was really fascinating about it is there are so many magazines out there that in kind of more niche-y design magazines that if they did this, I wouldn't blink an eye. But this is a magazine that is being delivered to CEOs of major companies and you would see this in waiting rooms of like small towns. This is not just some niche East Coast magazine necessarily."

  -
    content: "Laughter"
  -
    timestamp: "0:09:44"
    speaker: Chappell
    content: "'Cause it's a serious finance magazine. Like the information in it and the stories are great. And that's another reason I subscribe to it. It wasn't just the design. I actually kind of wanna learn about the world too. So yeah, it was something wholly unique and original. And yes, that lasted for what seemed three years and now they've tossed it out for a much more straightforward approach."

    timestamp: "0:10:09"

    content: "Yes."
  -
    timestamp: "0:10:13"
    speaker: Andy
    content: "And I don't know if it was intentional or not, but this month's issue is an issue that has a photo of Tim Cook on the cover. Basically right now, I would say the cover of Bloomberg Businessweek is... Like the art direction is photography, right? That's the whole thing. That we're gonna have good photography and then the typography is going to recede into the background, crystal goblet it's way out of your mind. You're just gonna be engaged in this big photography. And it's interesting that this month is where they're kind of unveiling a new design, I guess, or at least it's more minimal."
  -
    timestamp: "0:10:46"
    speaker: Andy
    content: "And one of the most famous covers under their previous art direction, one of their most out there ones was also a cover of Tim Cook, where it was this kind of like almost alien photo of him smiling in a little bit otherworldly way. And this like big, diagonally set, cursive font in neon colors, like writing his name across his face on the cover, which I remember when that cover came out and I remember defending it to all of my friends who don't work in the design industry and for once felt like they had something to talk to me about. They're like, \"Hey, you're the graphic designer. What did they do with this thing? What a real barf pile.\" [laughter] And defend it to death. So yeah, I think a lot of designers are in your shoes, Chappell, where it's like, \"This is the one thing maybe I subscribe to or, at least was following and now they've kind of gone the way of every other magazine and it'll be impossible to tell them apart from the Economist or whatever, because it's just the same old thing.\""
  -
    timestamp: "0:11:45"
    speaker: Chappell
    content: "Well, I think there's a balance because there were times in which the kind of crazier design of Businessweek, it sometimes encroached upon the writing. And I'm coming from the space of a writer more than I am as a practicing designer, so words are super important to me and there were times where I was reading and I was like this is kind of actually feeling like it's taking away from the writing."
  -
    timestamp: "0:12:18"
    speaker: Andy
    content: "Interesting."
  -
    timestamp: "0:12:18"
    speaker: Robyn
    content: "That's right, but also I think in their case, and I think with most design's case, it's a collaborative effort right? Like writing and design, so it's about how they carve out the narrative, the story. So if the design or the photography creeps into the words, I think as long as it's like a collaborative effort between the three that makes sense but what's weird is that it might not be right. I don't know many media publications that a designer will go up to the writer and be like; \"this is what I'm thinking\" I might be interested to see how that went down because it's about crafting the whole story."
  -
    timestamp: "0:12:54"
    speaker: Chappell
    content: "Mm-hmm."
  -
    timestamp: "0:12:55"
    speaker: Andy
    content: "Yeah, I could definitely imagine. I certainly imagined that a more expressive and out there for lack of a better word design sensibility in the art direction of the magazine is not gonna be mutually exclusive to making the writing clearly understood. I'm sure there is a way to do it where you're really interesting and expressive graphics just enhance the writing and make it more understandable because of the way you're calling it out and kind of complimenting it. But there's also a way to do it such that it's not, and it actually is distracting and drawing attention away and I have to confess, I have never subscribed to the magazine, I have only seen nary a photo or two of a spread now and then and like some of the covers over the past three or four years. I've actually had very little exposure to it. I couldn't speak to whether or not that sensibility was helping or hurting the actual content, so I would defer to Chappell's opinion there."
  -
    timestamp: "0:13:46"
    speaker: Chappell
    content: "Yeah, I understand when you talk about \"weird design,\" which I think it's funny to call it that, when you talk about that, I really think it's important to be experimental, and honestly if you have some sort of mainstream publication that's opening the floodgate to the designers and saying, \"you know, go buck wild.\" You take that and you run with it because that is rare. Right?"
  -
    timestamp: "0:14:14"
    speaker: Robyn
    content: "Yeah."
  -
    timestamp: "0:14:14"
    speaker: Andy
    content: "And that's really what we're mourning right, like it's not that we're mourning that this was the most beautiful interesting magazine of all time it's that this was a huge publication that had all sorts of motivations to keep subscribers and appeal like you said to all different kinds of markets and yet here they were kind of throwing their weight behind a more experimental approach. Which I think feels validating as a designer, it feels like there's still room to do interesting and novel work in print and so to have that taken, I think is what people are mourning. I don't think people are like, \"That was my favorite magazine, I loved it so much and now it's ruined.\" I think they're just: \"Oh, that was one bastion of experimentality we had in the more corporate business world that we've lost.\""
  -
    timestamp: "0:14:56"
    speaker: Matt
    content: "I would suspect the majority of people who are mourning it, didn't even actually read it or to subscribe to it. Just saw it as: \"there is one place to go do weird stuff in the corporate world, oh now it's dead now we have no examples to point to.\""
  -
    timestamp: "0:15:10"
    speaker: Chappell
    content: "Yeah, you do have to know your audience at a point and I'm not looking at their demographics or probably the many decks of research they have around that but I can bet that that design was not targeted to their demographic. Hence the swing back to... I was reading, I can't remember who it was, the new... It was the editorial director I can't remember but they said that the redesign is getting rid of all the irony and I thought that was just really fascinating because if you're kind of a visual design nerd, insider, like we are, you look at stuff like that and I know there's a hint of irony in that weird design. There's so much kind of too cool for school weird kid, weird art kid irony, and I think that could be really off-putting for people who are not a part of that world."

  -
    timestamp: "0:16:16"
    speaker: Matt
    content: "I appreciate that that exist and I really enjoyed it while it was around. If I had to ask myself, \"do I wanna stand for that?\" Not really, I don't wanna just be weird and ironic for the sake of doing that. Not that I think that's exactly what we're talking about but I think you're right that there's a hint of that in there."
  -
    timestamp: "0:16:34"
    speaker: Chappell
    content: "Yeah, and it also showing from the perspective, like, I believe everything comes to an end. Everything comes and goes and waves and cycles and what's going to be interesting is that something like that three-year era of Businessweek is actually now this time capsule of really that peak weird design that was going on in that time. And that was like every designer's portfolio was starting to look like that and all the kids coming out of the European schools, out of Yale, all of them they'd bring in their portfolios, and for better for worse, they would look like that and so actually does encapsulate a movement in graphic design. So from a historical perspective, I think it's awesome that designers can work within these capitalists' job frameworks and find a way to express themselves and then it becomes part of the communal history if you will."
  -
    timestamp: "0:17:43"
    speaker: Chappell
    content: "Which I mean is a very positive way looking at it I have similar to Matt, I have major problems with when I've had to hire or work with designers in my professional life, who subscribe to that aesthetic, it's a massive problem. It almost always is. It's not for a mainstream consumer, and if a designer makes something for me with that aesthetic and I have to take it to my boss, and I would get fired. So..."

    speaker: Matt
    content: "Yeah."

  -
    timestamp: "0:18:15"
    speaker: Matt

I question just assuming that it doesn't appeal to a certain market, right.

Because we just did this, we barely touched this, we breathed on it, and therefore, we're kind of staying out of it as much as possible, being un-opinionated.\" So, do we have any evidence to suggest that that's actually what wealthy people, that are the, let's say, the most important audience in some ways, to...

And when this designer would create something, it would similarly look like Matt with saying, the opposite of what you'd expect from a professional graphic designer. It might be... It would look like something... The feedback from the client would be, \"This looks like something I made in Microsoft Word.\""

And so in the government, when you are paying a lot of money to hire professional designers, and they're giving you stuff that looks like your daughter's Quinceañera invitation, you get frustrated very easily. And in this, 'cause government is its own culture and there is some expectation of respecting the audience by organizing the information in a way that's very clear. 'Cause if the government's anything, if we want it to be anything, it's, \"Here are clear, simple instructions, to help you.\" And so in that context, trying something like that, it's unexpected there, and in a bad way. And it doesn't go over well with the audience, because they're steeped in that culture. And this is government, so it's not the best example, 'cause we have expectations of being clear to our populace. But, there are just times when it's not appropriate, or respectful, in a lot of ways. Like Matt is saying, there are times where you kind of worry. I would worry, as a designer, if I was respecting my audience. I think I'd think about that all the time. Because I would wanna balance experimenting and having fun and doing weird stuff if someone's letting me, but I also wanna make sure I'm not going over the audience's head in a way that makes them feel stupid, because that's design... For me that's design at its worst, is when the audience feels stupid."

Regardless of whatever your style is, I think the whole point of being a thoughtful designer in any editorial context is kind of approaching things with the understanding that each story is kind of different and needs kind of a special treatment. Maybe part of the problem here is just that the consistency of the playfulness and of the \"breaking the rules\" in the Businessweek stuff happens so often that, we have to assume it wasn't based on the content of the stories, it was actually this is what they wanted to do and so they kept doing it. But I have to imagine there would be a way to basically take the same approach that maybe we're thinking a more classical or more traditional graphic design approach would be and read the content, think about it, think about the subject matter of the issue and then, when you're trying to express that, give yourself a little more slack.

I'm guessing at some point there was somebody in leadership at Businessweek that said: \"the data from x month in 2012 was better than this date from this point, so we wanna push the design in this way.\" Like I'm guessing that's actually what happened. But in the process of that, we lost our cool design aesthetic in this one place that felt like a win. I think all visual designers were like, \"Wow, what a win in Bloomberg Businessweek. 'Cause they did it, so maybe we can push it.\" But specifically speaking, if Businessweek sold a lot less through that, and Lucky Peach, which is another one that pushed those boundaries, also dropped off.

It's like there's the assumption of whether a design working is whether it's selling, or whether it's not selling. And sure, that's the case in some standards, but if their success metric is getting a younger audience to read and they're selling less, but more people who are younger are reading it, then that feels like a win. So somebody's gotta make a trade off at that point. So I think at some point, I would say at the beginning, just like here are our success metrics of whether we think this is good or whether we think it's bad, and if we lose sales then we're okay with that. So from there then I would say like, \"Alright,\" and we're giving this like a six months timeline and we're gonna test it and see how it performs. And then we're gonna make a decision on how we iterate from there. So I think for me it would just be super iterative process that bases on what matters to the people in the room. Right?"

There's no real way to iterate on your process and find success. But I do wanna stand up a little bit for the fact that there are things that can't be measured. And if, you sold 60% as many copies, but you with somehow with all powerful omniscience knew that the 60% of those copies you sold went to people that were much more engaged with it. Or went to people that despite having no demographic differences were just more interesting, smart people and you were attracting the right people. Maybe not more people or something."

And I personally don't believe that that's all design is. I love the practicality of it. I love having a goal and aiming for it and being able to measure success. Especially in things like editorial, I think there is more there than just what can be measured. Which is not to say that I'm gonna sit in that room and try and convince people to let me put more squiggly lines on Tim Cook's face, but I do think there's a fair number of people out there that would feel that way."

But, if you thinking looking at other industries if you ever have a situation where people basically say, \"Well, we're gonna do what performs best or is most popular,\" you arrive very quickly at not the best television or the best movies, but in fact, the worst. Because a lot of times when you test things and do all your metrics on what's basically... Testing so often comes down to... And by testing I mean AB testing, having a value set that values a practical goal, oftentimes based in sales, so often comes down to offending the least people and not doing something interesting, such that you're really engaging the remaining population."

And that's the same thing if you're making this, boring magazine cover that everyone buys because it's on the newsstand and it's got that story they care about. But, no one loves it. And again, I don't know if that's the case. We're using Bloomberg as this continual example because it's convenient not because I think any of these things necessarily, specifically relevant to that example, but if that's the case if it's a matter of trying to appeal to everybody and in the process, not really having a deep relationship with anybody, I think that's another reason to do something that might perhaps be considered more experimental or more controversial.

It is so mediocre compared to what I think humans could be capable of and the sooner we can break people out of boxes the better.\" But of course that's very optimistic and lovely but it's really funny that we can even sit here and designers can get upset about maybe one magazine changing things up a little bit.

    content: "Well part of what gets me about that and part of why I mentioned the business people maybe still liking googly eyes thing is that, I feel like because the culture of graphic design is one that's sprung out of Corporate America, and sprung out of advertising and sprung out of capitalism, that the whole culture of graphic design is to make things that people think will appeal to people in suits maybe flying on a Learjet, right? If you look at what we consider core founding principles that's what you end up getting, is the kind of work that is clean cut, it's unoffensive, it's the establishment. We're designing the thing that looks like it's the established thing. And that's like a value that pervades the entire industry to the point that Matt earlier when he was talking about this was like, \"Oh, this is something that was like some animated GIF, this isn't even graphic design. This looks like something that you would just find if you looked up animated GIFs on the internet.\" When of course it's graphic design, it's still the same thing, we're using the same tools but when you venture even just a little bit... And honestly compared to Ray Gun or to Emma Gray, the Bloomberg Businessweek thing is like totally tame. It's barely experimental at all, it just uses some bright colors every once in a while."

All of a sudden you're disrespectful, you're pushing people away, you're being totally experimental and off the wall and crazy. And I agree Chappell, I feel like why is there not more variance allowed for within what most people consider the safe bounds of graphic design? These things can be executed well, they take skill to make, they do express more things more vibrantly than grids and grotesque typefaces. Part of me mourns that when I see the magazine change back. It's like, \"Well there goes another thing that at least we could've learned from.\" Something I always say that... I don't know where I heard it first but it really resonated with me was that, \"If you're in battle and you fire a mortar and it lands too short, when you fire the second one it better land too long.\" If you're adjusting your aim, you don't wanna be too short and then too short again, and then too short again, 'cause it gets way harder to actually hit your target. And I feel like all of graphic design, like 98% of it, you could clump into the way not experimental enough, not pushing the boundaries enough, totally square, inside the box, completely boring and sterile."

As soon as that happens, it exists for a few years and then it gets kinda cut back and here we are firing all of our mortars short again and nobody's being expressive."

And that started happening in the '60s, it really started coming to a head. That divide still totally exists."

When you're hungry a short-order cook is a problem solver, when you need something explained visually a graphic designer is a problem solver. So these are really, really... It's an important thing to do to provide a service for a person but at the same time now that I have distance from government I see that maybe I was going a bit crazy there and that [chuckle] there is this for kind of designer as expression, as expressive... As an expressive person and that's getting away from the grid and busting out of the grid. And expressing something in the way you feel you want to do it in and that's not maybe as comfortable for some people. It certainly wasn't comfortable for me again working where I was working but it's really, really important that all these things exist together. Whether or not you can be that expressive in a mainstream publication I don't know, I don't know that it's totally possible for a long term but that's okay. I think that design is supposed to be... It is trend based and any experimentation it's gonna come and go. It's just the deal."

    content: "There's something I wanna make sure we mention which we've kind of been talking around a little bit and that's like those two sides of an argument you mentioned. Chappell as we said they're both right, nobody's wrong. Graphic design is not meant to be anything, graphic design is just the process of giving shape and form to ideas on a surface of some kind and... But I think the important thing to note is that of that divide like one side is clearly in power. The side that is making things that are \"practical, utilitarian\" that is doing the sterile work, that's how you get the jobs at the places that pay well. The people making experimental work they're making their DIY posters and zines and they're doing their fun stuff but no one's paying them to do it. They're not paying them a whole lot of money. That's part of the reason why the Bloomberg thing specifically was like, \"Here's an example of people doing experimental expressive work.\" and they're doing it for a company they're presume being paid pretty well for their labor. Here's somebody that's doing the kind of work that we, in some ways, wanna celebrate and they're doing it in a way that it's practical but the fact that so few design studios, companies whatever, higher designers that work that way means that of course all of the colleges and universities that teach graphic design... And they teach graphic design with the goal of getting people jobs when they graduate."

That's not a great end game for them if they're trying to run their little business of being a school and so the thing that gets rewarded with money is the thing that self-perpetuates and that's how we end up with the certain type of design that is in power and another type of design which is it's... I think it's an ideal in some ways that in the world of capitalism is very hard to realize practically and so when it happens on a rare circumstance it's beautiful and then when it stops happening it's like, \"well you know capitalism done chewed it up as it always does.\" [chuckle]"

This is kind of like they were... If you're raised you know \"raised\" in college on looking at these Tumblrs and seeing this sort of visual language you adopt it whether consciously or not and so you see these trends in... I feel like every... Right now the major trend of every website and Subway ad is where the background looks like someone sneezed confetti on it and it's like little doodles, little squiggles, and triangles and I'm like, \"Is this because all designers right now are of age that they all have Trapper Keepers growing up.\""

And it's like looking at an alien control panel where nothing is in the language I speak, and it's just various shapes all over the place and gestures to do everything. Like it very much is an interface that you have to assume from looking at it, they didn't sit down and say \"We need to make this as usable as possible to the widest audience\" which is what almost everyone does when they sit down to make an app."

And if the closest we have to that today is Metahaven and Tumblr, is that the same kind of equal? And then similar question in our industry, or at least not in my industry where we're doing software stuff, I wonder sometimes if there is room for that kind of thing and if the best equivalent we get is Snapchat and VSCO, however you, you pronounced it correctly, was it, what was it Robyn?"

They definitely were not thinking the same thoughts I think when I design an interface; which was like \"I gotta make this really clear\" they were like making it cool and expressive; which for me never having, like I downloaded it couple of times and been trying to use it and then just failed and I would give up, and that is kinda the thing I measure, but once you learn how to use it it's fine 'cause you have learned how to use it and it becomes muscle memory. But yeah that app has been successful. And so has Snapchat in spite of what I would consider to be really breaking the rules of UI designed. The rules we have like don't make people think that kinda stuff are being thrown out of the window, those things successful in spite of it, or because of it maybe."
  -
    timestamp: "0:56:39"
    speaker: Robyn
    content: "Sure, yeah. I would say calling Snapchat successful is difficult because, and even VSCO too. It's successful to a set of standards. They'll never be huge. I'm looking at Snapchat stock right now, that sold it for the $3 billion and it's running at $18 a share right now. So it's successful but it's not really that successful, and they have a wall that they're gonna hit, and the outline's gonna deal with it too, because it's that break in the main stream that's gonna be hard for them to push forward. In regards to VSCO, I think they're sort of a product of not being able to understand entirely what their product is gonna be. Because when they first started off, all that company was a company that produced film processing, so for actual cameras. Then they moved into Adobe Photoshop like Lightroom install that you could get your photos to look like it's old film, and then it pushed into app. But when they got into app, obviously because of Instagram, they were one of the first people that pushed that in the sense of like Instagram's filters were designed because we had really bad cameras, so they've made everything look like crap to make it look interesting, versus VSCO which like set out with the understanding of making it look good from the beginning."

    content: "But when they pushed themselves as a company and they got into storytelling, and that's when they broke. They didn't know what their app was gonna be and you could see it like, through the iconography for sure, like it's a trash app to use, and even if you do get them muscle memory down they change it every 45 seconds. But as a product itself, they just don't know what they are. They do this one thing really well; which is photo editing, but they wanted more. And I think as they pushed into more elements of their business, they just lost it. They lost the ability to have people update and understand what the UX was. So they're weird, and I do think there was a break of say like how successful some of these more interesting companies are. Like Snapchat they're loved, they're not that successful for how much they sold for."

And it was a little bit of different in this scale in which we called success right? I think you gotta have a clear understanding of what success is, if for Snapchat, if they're thinking to theirself \"Great, we just went public and our shares are $18\", that doesn't feel like that successful, that feels like \"Oh, wow, your shares are only $18\". So it's how you define success, what level are you comfortable with calling success. So I don't know. That's what I'd say."

And also the idea that editorial is a little bit closer to the art world that I think software is perceived as.

It felt like the app could fall apart at any minute, Like it's just barely held together with string kind of thing, but what was so fascinating about it, and what I think made it so successful among younger people is that it created this kind of garden wall effect, where younger people felt like that wall was just high enough that adults and people they don't want would just stay out on the other side of that wall."

They use their phone.\" I mean that's kind of true, but, when it comes to Snapchat, what was amazing about it is because the design was so lacking, it could only be mastered by actually interfacing with another person. And so, to see kids sit around, they would sit with each other and teach each other how to do it. And almost everyone I talked to who became really good at Snapchat, it was because someone sat with them and taught them. And I think that's actually a very interesting approach to software, but I'm sure that's not intended. I don't think they were like \"Let's design an app that gets people in a room together,\" but it's kinda part of what I think made it a success among younger people, and made it something that felt very sacred to them. And I don't know, though, that you can... It's always that thing. Can you grow with your audience? Can One Direction keep growing with its fans as they get older, or do you just stay with young fans?

When it was sitting on the ground, the gasoline would leak out of the plates of the plane [laughter], because if they had made it so when it was sealed and on the ground, when it got up to the speed of sound, the heat would cause it to fail.

What's the next step here?\" [laughter] Aside from making... Do you know how many ad agencies that probably poured hundreds of thousands of dollars into parallax scrolling microsites? You know?"

    content: "That's why I think. I dislike parallax scrolling too, but here's what I will say. I think people underestimate what can be learned with the right approach if you are willing to be more experimental in your work. It's not that the thing that's experimental is always gonna be better and you should just do the expressive out there thing because we believe that's better and that's what's important. But, back to my mortar analogy, I think if you allow yourself to maybe do something that feels wrong at first or is outside of the bounds of what the board of directors is going to accept because they're a bunch of stuffy old white guys sitting on the table. You do something that's going to maybe push them a little bit. There's things you can learn from all the conversations you have internally about it, all the conversation you have with your users and your customers about it. And, I think that's the one thing that people kinda leave out of the conversation because that's something it's hard to measure. How much did we learn? I don't know. Did we learn $10,000 worth of lessons or you know, it doesn't quantify it cleanly, so you end up kind of discounting it. But, I do think that it's only through making the kinda out there work that you end up..."

    content: "A really basic dumb example is that, when we're working... At my company, On Design Things, we have a rule of like, \"make the thing that you think is ugly and show it to people.\" If you make an ugly thing you have to show it to everybody because even if you think it's ugly, you're probably be right it probably is ugly, there might be something redeeming in it that you're not seeing because you just only see the ugly bit."

We can never put that on the internet or print that or whatever, but this one aspect of it is actually really interesting. Can we focus on that and kind of pull it out?\" And, I think that that same approach is no reason that you can't take that same approach on a bigger scale if you have less strict rules about what you will or will not let out the door of your company, whatever you're doing."

    content: "You know, if you always listen to music that sounds good or always watch TV that makes you feel good you probably will not grow or at least grow so fast as you could be right? And, I, to bring it back to Businessweek as we did in the beginning, I subscribed to that magazine because, again, they were trying new things but it also really challenged me and there were times I would open a spread and be all like, \"I don't know if I like this.\" And, that's a really good feeling to have in a world of so much sameness and when you immediately say, \"I don't know if I like this\" it gives you an opportunity to really examine because that's just called bias and it's a really great moment to examine bias and then all of a sudden maybe you're gonna unlock some door that you'll get to walk through and you'll find this whole new life you can live where all of a sudden, you know what? I do like googly eyes on pigs and I never thought I would. And so, I think it is important to put the stuff in your path and in your way to keep challenging you and even though... I mean, yes, I get it. A magazine isn't like the most challenging thing in life. But, if you can challenge yourself visually, it's gonna help you expand so much and get to the next thing in your life. And that's my schmeal."

    speaker: Matt
    content: "You know, I feel like Chappell in that like I could almost defend either side of this because sometimes I am doing work and I'm happy and everything's great and I don't feel like I need to be experimental and then sometimes I'm very bored with what I'm doing and I'm like I need to do something weird and experimental 'cause I'm boring. But, I do... I mean, the one thing I do always come back to is like even just this question of like, \"Is graph design personal expression or whatever?\" The thing I at least I can do when I know will be right is trying to express logic some way. And I guess that's another way of just expressing myself 'cause I think the logical thing is the right thing to do. Also, the world's not so logical and reasonable that that's even boring. I think we're actually in a... I think we could express logic a little bit better and maybe we'd be in a better world 'cause people would do reasonable things."

    timestamp: "1:10:39"
    speaker: Matt
    content: "So, I dunno. I think... That's the closest I can come up with for like why I'm motivated to do any sort of design work, is just try to express the logic of whatever I'm doing. The only time anything ever bugs me is if I think it's a style. If I think I'm just seeing weird design 'cause someone else saw weird design and they saw a weird design and now it's just repeated. But if it's an expression of what is best for that piece, that article, whatever. I'm all in. I love it. And, I also get a kick out of it when I see it for the first time. I wanna see something new. Yes, please."

    timestamp: "1:11:46"
    speaker: Robyn
    content: "I like weird design. I think it's fun and engaging. If you want to make weird design make sure you have a business buy off before you do it so that way when the going gets tough you can be like, \"Hey what's up. Remember we had that conversation we knew this was gonna happen so you can't let go\". And I think that's important to do with any sort of design, but especially if you're gonna push the needle in an environment that is kinda into it or kind of not into it, make sure that you have everybody in the room being like \"Yep, we agreed to this. Remember, this is the thing, we knew this was gonna happen.\" So we are able to engage in that content a lot stronger. I guess that's my final thought would just be, \"Get buy in and push the needle as much as you can and listen to Nada Surf in the process.\""

You might get bad data or you might just get a weird off put insight for two weeks, but let's commit to this for six months, for three years; three years is a big commit. And then we make our assessment after that.\" I think ultimately Bloomberg Businessweek started on the bottom, got really up high and is now somewhere in the middle, and that's okay. If you get weird design, go and read the Outline, go read 538, go read Vice 'cause those are where those designers went to push stuff, so be the new generation of pushers."
