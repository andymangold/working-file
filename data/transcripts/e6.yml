    content: "So, yeah. Welcome to Working File, Episode 5-ish depending on how we numbered them. This is a design panel discussion podcast where couple of designers talk to a couple other designers, and we talk about design stuff, and we try to do it in a good way, and not a bad way. And have interesting conversations that are actually compelling. I'm Andy, and Matt you're joining me as always from Philadelphia. Hello, Matt."

He's an inter-disciplinary designer, an engineer, and he's working on merging design, AI, and the future tooling. But first, he needs to figure out how to work his computer in general: Skype, Google Hangouts, basic microphones, anything before he can get to all that fancy AI stuff."

    content: "Alright, so as I mentioned, tonight I wanna discuss broadly the relationship between design and production. I wanna start just by having everybody talk about their own personal relationship between design and production. I will start with me so you have some time to think about your own personal relationship between design and production. I am a trained graphic designer. I have a degree in graphic design. That is what I would have to put on... That's what I probably have on LinkedIn right now if I were to check. Not that I remember what that is. And so, what that means to me is I have an understanding of color, form, typography, composition, hierarchy, all these fun words we used to describe design generally."

    timestamp: "04:37"
    speaker: Andy
    content: "And for most of my life, I've also produced the things that I have designed, which I didn't realize until actually much later on, like when I was in college that what I was doing my entire life was designing. I thought it was just tinkering or making stuff, but really I was designing things and I was implementing them in whatever fashion that was. So, I do occasional woodwork. I write CSS at work. I wouldn't say I'm a full front-end developer because JavaScript is still completely unintelligible to me for the most part, but I do write CSS and HTML and build most of the front end of the web sites and work on in that sense. So for me, it's something that I've always done, is done both the design and the production side of most of the things I'm involved in. But I will say that the most valuable things I've ever made have been in collaboration with people that possessed production skills I myself did not possess. And that was some of the work that was most valuable to me. So with that, Matt, I'm gonna make you go next."

    timestamp: "05:39"
    speaker: Matt
    content: "I feel like I've had this weird journey from making stuff on the web and just making things that I can make on the web. Well, I'll learn enough programming to make the thing I wanna make, and that'll be the extent of the production, to getting an actual graphic design degree and learning how to do that, to going and working in a traditional firm where I would do a little less web and a little more like design a book, design a poster, or ad campaign that gets printed, or design a 3D object. And now I'm much more back in the world of designing things for the web, but this time I'm not producing them because I'm actually a bad programmer."

  -
    timestamp: "06:30"
    speaker: Andy
    content: "And fair to say you weren't also printing enormous books and doing the production when you were at your more traditional graphic design job, right? You were working with vendors and you were getting things made, but you weren't yourself making them."

    timestamp: "07:25"
    speaker: Linda
    content: "But we would tie these little pieces of trash bags together to make Christmas wreaths. She would just have those types of crazy craft projects. And no matter how lame the project was, I wanted to be the best at it. I just had to be the best in the class at whatever projects that we made, so it was always this solo thing where I wanted to draw cartoons, and just make stick houses out in the yard, like whatever. But it was never a collaborative process, so I think that... Eventually I ended up going to design school just like you, and learning all those things. And I think it was still kind of like the every man for herself, or woman for herself, kind of feeling where it was a little competitive and you don't really want to work with other people because you still kind of want to be the best at whatever you're doing. And yeah, so slowly over time I've had to learn that if you want to get really good work done you have to work with people who are good at your weaknesses. So, yeah."
  -
    timestamp: "08:35"
    speaker: Andy
    content: "So has this carried over into your professional work now? Do you still like to be in charge of everything and not only design something but make it, or make a prototype of it? Or do you work now with vendors and programmers and printings and whatever to get things made?"
  -
    timestamp: "08:50"
    speaker: Linda
    content: "Yeah, I've gotten really good at handing things over and just being like, You do this because I suck at it. [chuckle] And yeah, it started at MailChimp and working with the dev team there. We worked really closely with the front end team. And also, just if we ever needed anything printed we would go to the printer and watch them work, and approve of things, and it was really awesome. So then, at Dropbox, you work with a whole dev team a lot of the time, and that was a big learning challenge for me. But I think it's all for the best, and yeah, now I feel like I have a pretty good working relationship with a lot of people. It's really nice; it takes a lot of the stress off of you."
  -
    timestamp: "09:36"
    speaker: Andy
    content: "So Jon, I know you pride yourself on being able to produce the things you design, at least when it comes to programming. Can you talk a little bit about what your relationship is between these two kinds of sides of the practice?"
  -
    timestamp: "09:50"
    speaker: Jon
    content: "Yeah. I feel like it's changed, or it's evolving over the past couple of years. Like the rest of you I also did a graphic design degree, and I think for a long time I assumed that I would always, always be a graphic designer. I loved doing print design. That stopped being the case somewhere around when I was graduating, I guess. And I always coded in different capacities, and I've been trying to piece together why that was. And I think there's a couple of reasons there. Part of it I think was my way of dealing with impostor syndrome, I always coded more because I thought I was a bad designer and it was my way of masking it. It was also quite nice because as a self-taught developer I could also mask myself there as well. I could be like, Oh, I'm just a designer, it doesn't matter if my code's bad. So it was kind of self-preservation on both levels."
  -
    timestamp: "10:49"
    speaker: Jon
    content: "And there are a couple of other reasons in there that maybe we can get into, but over the past couple of years it's definitely evolved from a designer who writes some HTML and some CSS to a designer who definitely codes and thinks other designers should code to at the moment, I don't really like job titles but I feel like right now I'm very, very 50/50, like software engineer/designer. I've started using the title software engineer occasionally recently, which is weird because I definitely never thought I would feel comfortable calling myself a software engineer, but life is weird, I guess."
  -
    timestamp: "11:23"
    speaker: Andy
    content: "That's actually a good transition Jon, because the place I want to start with this conversation is, there is some subset of designers, or people that do a lot of writing and tweeting about design that would say that designers today have to be involved with the production. Specifically they have to if not know how to code the things they're designing, they need to understand how they're sort of put together. And I think that argument is based on two assumptions; one assumption is that the designer that is more prepared to be able to write some code is more prepared for employment in the future."
  -
    timestamp: "12:00"
    speaker: Andy
    content: "Everything is gonna be computers, we're gonna live in Tron, The Matrix. So, the more you program computers just the better your job prospects are. And the other one which is the one I'm more interested in, is the idea that, I've heard from a number of people that I respect significantly that their belief that being closer to the thing that you're designing, understanding how it's made, understanding what goes into the actual production of it, makes you better at designing it. Is that something you believe Jon, that understanding how it's made, being involved in the production will make you better at doing your job when it comes to the design side of your job?"
  -
    timestamp: "12:38"
    speaker: Jon
    content: "Yeah, I think that's one of the things that I'm pretty confident about. I think you have to understand the materials that you're working with. There are so many analogies that you could draw but I think an artist that doesn't understand the materiality of oils versus canvases versus acrylics versus... I'm really bad at art so I'm gonna stop with this analogy, I can't paint for shit. But generally I think you design better things when you understand the materiality of it. If you wanna add some show notes, I think the first thing we can throw in is Jony Ive did a fantastic talk at the Design Museum in London a couple of years ago and it really, really resonated with me. He was talking about how the way that things were designed at Apple in hardware design intensely reflected the materials they were using when they switched from that translucent plasticky stuff to aluminum or aluminium as we call that. It changed the way that they..."
  -
    timestamp: "13:40"
    speaker: Andy
    content: "Yeah, you have to say it the British way, we have to go all ham on that. Aluminium, yeah, come on. Aluminium, it's good."
  -
    timestamp: "13:45"
    speaker: Jon
    content: "Aluminium. Aluminium."
  -
    timestamp: "13:45"
    speaker: Linda
    content: "Aluminium."
  -
    timestamp: "13:46"
    speaker: Matt
    content: "Oh good, I didn't know what you were talking about before."

    timestamp: "13:47"
    speaker: Andy

    timestamp: "13:49"
    speaker: Linda
    content: "Be as British as you want."
  -
    timestamp: "13:52"
    speaker: Jon
    content: "When they switched to aluminum, the form of the creations changed. They used different angles, they used different methods of cutting and they could have different tolerances, all these difference things. Now that's kind of trite because it's metal versus JavaScript, but to me the metaphor really, really works. I just feel like we do infinitely better work when we really, really intensely understand the materiality of what we're working towards. And that could be things as specific as different rendering engines or different text layout engines, the differences between the web and iOS and Android. These are really technical things but they also impact the fidelity of your work and what you can achieve."
  -
    timestamp: "14:36"
    speaker: Matt
    content: "I wonder that all the time. How do you feel about this? Do you think the analogy really, really does work or do you think that's something we tell ourselves to feel better about being good at our jobs?"
  -
    timestamp: "14:44"
    speaker: Jon
    content: "Well, I've invested 10 years or 15 years in learning to code, so I can't be completely unbiased there, sorry, I couldn't..."
  -
    timestamp: "14:53"
    speaker: Matt
    content: "Because I feel that way very strongly about working with actual materials, like if we're talking about materiality and we're being literal about it, I think that makes a huge difference and I always felt like... When I first started doing print design professionally, I felt like I was fighting with it until I got a handle of what I can and can't do and then I was kind of working with the medium to make something better as opposed to just yelling at a printer and being like, Why can't we do this?"
  -
    timestamp: "15:21"
    speaker: Andy
    content: "Yeah, at first Matt was like, Can we just fold this wood? and turn... I can't think of something you can't do with metal. Metal's a very..."

    speaker: Matt
    content: "Why can't you just print that on gold?"

    timestamp: "15:30"
    speaker: Andy
    content: "Yeah."
  -
    timestamp: "15:30"
    speaker: Linda
    content: "But I think that that's different because like in a physical medium the constraints are pretty much set in stone, and with technology the constraints are changing so much and so quickly."
  -
    timestamp: "15:41"
    speaker: Matt
    content: "That's why I wonder because I feel very strongly that my understanding... Like me being bad at coding helps me be good at designing for code, but I don't know if that's true. I don't know if that's something I just tell myself because it's a really good real world analogy, and I might also be as good at designing if I didn't code poorly in the medium. I'm not sure if it's true."
  -
    timestamp: "16:06"
    speaker: Andy
    content: "Part of me wonders if it's just one of these things that the idea of it is so beautiful, you just want to believe it's true. Like the idea that somehow being close to the material and the actual physicality of something and the production of it is gonna make you better at it, but the thing I always go back to is, I should say, I adhered to this idea strongly for a long time and then one day I was kind of like, Well, wait a minute. I know how to make websites. I've been writing HTML and CSS for 16 years and I know how to write Ruby On Rails a little bit, I can make my way around a project. I know how websites are made, I understand it. And I design websites. I also design iOS apps and I don't know anything about how iOS apps are made. I know that you use Objective-C in Swift and there's this thing called Xcode and it breaks all the time, but I don't understand anything about that. My depth of knowledge about that is so much lower, so if we're adhering to this idea that understanding of the means of production makes you that much better, am I a terrible designer for iOS apps but passable on the web?"
  -
    timestamp: "17:04"
    speaker: Matt
    content: "Guys, this is that moment where we all tell Andy he's just terrible at iOS."
  -
    timestamp: "17:07"
    speaker: Jon
    content: "Let's take this iOS as an example you understand the relationship between I don't know, UI navigation controllers and UI tab bar controllers and you understand the way that things fit together, you understand the way the pieces fit together, and you could say, Well, that's just the paradigm, that's not close to the metal, but I think it is. If you understand how a navigator layers scenes up or something that, that kind of is that. Or if you're like, Oh, we can use maps now and we can geolocation because there is blah blah blah, that's kind of understanding the medium. You might not have to understand how Objective-C allocates objects or I don't know. But it's understanding the SDKs, it's understanding what tools are available."
  -
    timestamp: "17:51"
    speaker: Andy
    content: "Yeah, that's how I feel about it to. I think people oftentimes confuse knowing how to do the production work with an understanding of the constraints in which you're working. And there are certainly situations where you would be helped by trying it out. Like it'd be cool to have an architect to go on the field with some construction company and see what it's like to frame out a building maybe. But I don't think that's essential to doing that job well. I think you can understand the limitations and the constraints. And that is just how I think we should be defining design in all industries and especially on the web is like you don't get to understand the web unless you understand these constraints. And that doesn't mean you have to be able to rattle off a bunch of your favorite Java Script libraries and sit down and build a whole website. It just means that you have to kind of understand the language."
  -
    timestamp: "18:37"
    speaker: Linda
    content: "Now I think it's just important for people to understand that they don't have to do everything themselves. I like what you're saying about how you should have a basic knowledge for how this thing works. But if you're not doing it regularly like all the time, I feel like it's really hard to stay up to date and to have a really honed skill in coding. And so, I would end up just using myself is a pretty huge constraint honestly. When I'm figuring out what's possible for a project, I just end up not thinking as wide as I could if I'm working with an engineer who's like, Ooh, have you thought about this? And what about this?"
  -
    timestamp: "19:19"
    speaker: Matt
    content: "Actually, I was gonna ask a question, almost the opposite of that. Do you ever find that because you know something and you know one thing is easier to do than another, that you choose the easier path? And maybe there's no reason that that easier path is the better path. Maybe it's worse. But you know it's easier to implement, so you think, Well, let's just do this. And maybe if you didn't know, you'd be less constrained and you'd do an objectively better job because you're free of that constraint?"

    timestamp: "19:47"
    speaker: Andy
    content: "Yeah."
  -
    timestamp: "19:47"
    speaker: Linda
    content: "Yeah. Exactly and I think that sometimes designers and engineers need each other because I'll pitch an idea to the engineer and you can kinda see their brain melt a little bit. They're like, Really? We gotta do... Ugh."

And two, yes, designers should learn anything. But I think one of the reasons, one of the many reasons that I like programming is it's like a feedback loop thing. So you could be like a good designer and a good developer or, a good designer and a good business person; your feedback loop is gonna be shortened immensely by being a good designer and a good engineer and then, collaborate, having a good business person working with you, versus what it would be like if you're a good designer and a good business person working with a good engineer. I think business is useful, but it doesn't affect the design process as much as engineering does."

But if you're working with a larger team, I think it's then more a question of relationship building, you need to have a really good relationship with the person building the thing you're designing.

I would say my time is probably split, actually almost perfectly into thirds between doing design work, doing what I guess you could loosely call business work. Taking meetings, writing proposals, talking to people about their ideas, sales, whatever you wanna call it. And then, a third doing software development, writing CSS and HTML for projects that are active. My experience has been that I have definitely felt my design work become lazy in the sense that I know what is very easy to build and I'm very likely to favor that over something that is more difficult to build in a way that I have to force myself to say, Let's actually try a little harder on this, because I know this would take 45 minutes and that's really appealing because it's probably 85% as good as the best thing we'll ever come up with and it takes so little time. But I've to actually force myself to say, No, let's keep pushing, even though this is a totally satisfactory, efficient solution because efficiency is not always the best thing."

    content: "And the other thing I'll say is that I don't think... Again, from the most bias position ever. I am me. I can't really tell in any sense of objectivity what I'm actually doing. But it doesn't feel like my design work has been as positively influenced by my awareness of how things are built, but I will say my development work has been extremely, positively influenced by understanding the design that I'm building. And a practical example of that is if you hand off some still image of a website you designed to a developer and asked them to build it, most of them will look at it and say, Okay, great. This is 35 pixels. This text is this big. This thing is this hex color. But if you're the person that designed it, you know that, Yeah sure, that's 35 pixels, but it's actually twice as big as this thing over here, and yeah sure, that's this particular hex code but it's actually a mixture of these two other colors that are used elsewhere."

    content: "And the way these things break down, the way these elements behave is actually all system and when you're writing CSS, you can build that system instead of just building the results of it, which is why I think a lot of engineers that don't understand the design process or having communicated with their design teams end up doing and then the designers are like, Oh, can we just change this one little simple thing and then Dev is like, No, but that's a million little changes because everything breaks when you break that little thing. And they didn't realize that the system was designed with some degree of variability in it. So, take that with a grain of salt because... But that's my experience. I feel like my development work is better."

If you're finding that there are barriers between two people's job titles, well, maybe that barrier just shouldn't be there and there should just be a new job called Internet makerer. I think I used that for awhile. That's a dumb name."

I know you did a lot of environmental signage and stuff at your previous job. From what I've observed... I'm always curious about the relationship between an architect and the people that are actually gonna build the building that is designed by the architect and how much that engineering comes into play in architecture versus we're gonna come up with the vision, then the engineers will figure out how to make it actually stand and not blow over. Recognizing that you are not an architect and have not worked in the industry, do you have any insight into that relationship? And the broader question is, what other examples of the relationship between design and production can we, in our industry, possibly learn from?"

    speaker: Matt
    content: "Man, I definitely haven't been the architect, as you said, but I've seen some architects who just, clearly, make a form, and then work with engineers to make that possible, which I feel is the approach of, whether I understand the constraints of the material or not, I don't care. I want to make a form and we're gonna work as hard as we can to make that form possible. I think the famous example is the Frank Gehry using software to make airplanes to make a building, because AutoCAD just can't do that. I don't care if AutoCAD can't do that, we're gonna find another way to do it. And some architects as engineers only make things that are structurally possible because that's their training, and then they can make beautiful things from that, but I feel like they wouldn't go outside that constraint, because it's not part of their ethos."

I think Frank Gehry is a great example of somebody who will definitely pick form first, create a sculpture, and then it's not like he's gonna build something that will fall apart, but he will work with engineers to make it possible, and ignore the constraints of current technology, and maybe push forward and create new technology for that reason, but I think a lot of architects probably would see that as unreasonable and just go with, I'm gonna build something that is both the thing I wanna make and structurally sound and possible. And I think you're gonna find most architects have a very sound understanding of construction and physics and whether a building falls over."

This is what we're shooting for. Now let's put all of our resources to the test to see if we can get as close to this, and I think of concept cars. You go to some auto show, and they have these concept cars that look crazy and otherworldly, and then they get put through the normalization of, well actually, aerodynamics, well actually, how these parts are made, well actually, how much it costs to make a fender look like that, and they pop out looking like Camrys every time."

It's a goal, realizing we might have to change some things to make it actually happen, but the idea is that it's something in the distance versus the idea of we know what's possible, we're going to work within those constraints, and we're going to figure out practical, efficient, beautiful as well, solutions that are part of that conversation. I, as the person, designing this building would never draw something on a piece of paper or in a computer program that could not be built, because I know it can be built and I'm gonna be aware of those limitations."

The most exciting stuff I've seen end up get built was an insane idea that at the beginning started with a meeting with the production team going, This is crazy. There's no way this can happen. And then eventually working towards, Oh, okay. Here's how we're gonna make it work. But it needed that crazy idea to start with in order for it to ever happen, because if you just said, Nope, not gonna happen, and then started with the one that we know works, the wild thing's not gonna get built. That hurts my brain, because I don't like thinking about design that way. I like thinking about design as, you know your materials, you know what you're doing."

So, we've talked about designers or architects without a knowledge of the form doing crazy, wild things and that's fair, we see that in graphic design, especially we see that at ad agencies and stuff. And then we've talked about designers, architects knowing the material producing... I don't know what you... How would you say it? Like stale or sensible designs? Because they... How do you know it's achievable and they don't push it. But what about technologically enabled designers producing crazy things that would never ever have been possible without the machines? And I'm thinking about AI, in this sense, I'm thinking about... Did you see that industrial design thing the other... Maybe that's a couple of months ago where it was like a structural optimization thing where the machine designed a crazy, crazy 3D form that a human would just never, ever think of. And I'm thinking about machine-aided creativity being more exciting than human initiated or human driven creativity."

It's not even a thing. Somebody draws like, What if your phone was inside of your hand and it just shot laser beams out and that's how you can make phone calls? Like cool, super. You're not being a visionary interesting designer, you're just inventing things, which that's a valuable thing in its own right but there's a difference between science fiction and making things up and actually being somewhat aware of the limitations but pushing them.

And there's all at once this somewhat reasonable like, We have to actually build this thing, but also this willingness to say, We're gonna try for something that may not be conventionally considered possible. And then, that's that sweet spot where, you do actually get to make unique and interesting work because you're not just dreaming of nonsense. I don't mean to sound so harsh on fiction because fiction is valuable too, but not in this particular context I would argue. There's a sweet spot there and I don't know how to put boundaries around it."

I'd like to think that I'm better than that because I have experience but, doing something many times and then pulling out the one sounds very robotic to me and that's kind of how I like to do design work and come up with new ideas. Do you guys also do the same thing or is that just totally foreign?"

I think there's a lot of like exciting things about design that get masked because we have lots of road work to do and I think... At least let's use... Let's build better tools to enable designers to do more of the fun stuff. Whether or not that is writing code or not, I think there are better tools that could be created together."

I think a lot of times I'll see people get a project and they'll look to ways that it's been done before instead of looking to the thing that they're actually trying to make. And I don't know, I think it's something that we all need to challenge ourselves on a little bit more. Because it's easy to live in the dream world, where you're designing the iPhone in your hand but I think that there needs to be something between that and the annoying website that scrolls 19 different ways. It's like let's push."

Yeah, we've all seen that. So I have a proposal; I think maybe here's what it comes down to. I always like to try and figure out... This is probably a situation where there is not obviously one way that is better to do it. I suspect that there's probably just a certain nature to the work that is made in either way. There's probably value to the, We're gonna sit down, we're gonna dream big. If we're not ignorant of limitations of production already, we're going to free ourselves of them, we're gonna ignore them for now. We're gonna design in a way that is ambitious. There's value to that, there's probably certain projects that are suited to that, and there's probably a certain nature to that work, in the same way there's probably a certain nature to the work that says, Alright, well, we have a practical problem to solve. Let's sit down with the tools we know we have available to us, we know we have dominion over, and let's just make it happen."

    content: "I'd be remiss not to mention, for listeners that aren't familiar, this was tried very much in architecture. Samuel Mockbee was the architect who ran something called the Rural Studio, which basically took architecture students that were in architecture programs, and put them into situations where they were designing and manufacturing and building small buildings for people in need. And we'll ignore the social whatever aspect of it because that's not what I'm interested in at this point. What I'm interested in right now is the idea of a big thesis of that program was you, as an architect, should touch the building. You should be physically involved, you should be close to the material. And you look at those projects, and I don't know how successful, long-term any of them are, how actually practical they are, I don't know if they leak, but they're beautiful. They're beautiful experiments and simple architecture that's made relatively easily. And so, I have to just assume that there are projects that are suited to both of these approaches, and there's a time and a place for each. And so, I'm just curious what is that time and place? What is the context? When should you not be ambitious and reinvent the wheel, and ignore production? And when should you pay close attention to those things?"

Then I also feel like the projects that I've done that I'm the most happiest with is things that I've done on my own time when there is no budget. And those are the things where I've not quite reinvented the wheel, gone somewhere to do that. And those are things where I've coded stuff as well. I think I'm more creative when I code rather than less."

    content: "For me, I think... The thing I always say in the office when we're talking about these things is I always say that you can justify a new design if we're talking about a new thing. This is not a new thing. Don't try and make a new design for it. If we're just making a contact form, don't try and reinvent the contact form, probably. But if we're talking about an actually new thing, here is a unique aspect of whatever entity we're designing for, we're trying to represent that is somewhat special, or at least, you wanna draw attention to, then yes, let's let the reins go a little bit, let's maybe do something that takes a little more time to implement, that's a little bit less aware of, limitations, because that's where energy should be focused. And that's, I guess, where my frustration comes from when I see somebody that's totally reinvented the one-page restaurant website where everyone just wants the hours and the stupid address. It's like, Great! Cool! Glad you poured your totally reinventing juice into this problem, and not something that maybe you could've actually used to be totally reinvented.

And that's where I draw the ledge for myself in my own work is like, Am I gonna spend a bunch of time trying to do this thing that's been done over and over again way differently? If I think it's working okay, probably not. But I am gonna focus that time on trying to do something that maybe is unique or special in a different way.

And I'm not an expert in any of those things, but I always find some little nugget of truth or universality when I'm listening to somebody talk about how they're working with whatever production studio to make something. So I always value looking outside of whatever little bubble we're in to try and figure out what this relationship actually might mean on a bigger level. Matt, closing thoughts?"

We are coming back to architecture here, where they've been like, Oh my God, I've just been reading all these articles about UX and UI design and blah blah blah, on Medium and one, oh my God, your industry is so cool and open in its sharing of information. I think architecture is a very confined, very siloed thing where people keep their cards close to their chest. And the other thing they say to me after that is, It's so cool that you have this insane feedback loop where you can think of something and you can build it that afternoon, whereas they might be designing a bathroom unit for a skyscraper that will get built in 20 years time. And I think, if anything, we should just be tending towards the strengths of our industry. If people are looking out from industries we aspire to be in, and we're like design nerds, we love architecture, and the architects are being like, Oh my God, digital product design has these traits that we love, I'm just like, Dude, let's just keep pushing for that as far as it goes because it seems like we're on to a good thing."

But I also think you don't have to feel guilty or ashamed if you're more into lettering, or illustration, or whatever than you are into coding. And I just think that as long as you follow those things, and really pursue them then that's great. But then, if you are ignoring learning how to code, then you need to develop a really good relationship with the person who is coding it, even if you have to set up a list of guidelines and just talk to each other, come out of your hole and talk to each other and figure out the best way to work with each other.
