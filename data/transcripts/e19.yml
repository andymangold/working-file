    content: "Alright. Let's dive into this. Somebody, either Jon or Annie I think, can you give us just a background on what we are actually talking about? When we say 'artificial intelligence,' if someone is not familiar with the practical, real-world, current applications for artificial intelligence, they're thinking of HAL 9000 or whatever. What do we mean when we say 'artificial intelligence'?"
  -
    timestamp: "0:03:36"
    speaker: Jon
    content: "I would say artificial intelligence refers to systems that can learn to think and can learn to pick out rules in unfamiliar data. We can personify things with big, scary, red, laser eyes and that kind of personification; I think that's what IBM are doing with Watson and it's kinda bullshit. But mostly we're talking about machines that can think beyond specific things that they've been programmed to do."

    content: "And I think most people, not everybody, but most people are pretty resigned to the fact that... Gosh, I don't know how to say this without being politically incorrect, but unskilled labor jobs, jobs that basically are repetitive, they're a task that can just be done repetitively with no variation from instance to instance. Those kind of jobs, I think most people kind of understand, probably as technology continues to get more affordable, more efficient, are likely to disappear. And in many industries have already disappeared to automation, right? Like there are very few... What's the thing where everyone gets in a line and everyone does one part of something?"

    content: "I think there are very few assembly lines that are left in modern factories, with the caveat that there is kind of the whole social and political mess in certain parts of the world where even though factory... Machines to do assembly line labor are available there are people that can pay absolute no wages at all to do it for even cheaper. Besides from that weird social political force, which is a whole 'nother topic we won't get into tonight, I think most people accept that labor jobs are likely to disappear to automation at some point. And I think a lot of people are unfamiliar with the idea that what some people might call 'creative jobs' could also potentially disappear or at least be significantly augmented and changed dramatically by technology."

    content: "Are there examples of this, that of... One example I can think of that I always come back to is one thing I think people kinda feel like is super-innately human and can never be automated is comedy, right? Like telling a joke and making people laugh is this really, deeply human thing that involves relating to people and making an interesting observation that's unexpected. And it's hard to program unexpected things. And yet I find myself literally laughing out loud at Twitterbots constantly on Twitter because of the weird ways they'd combine things."

    timestamp: "0:06:38"
    speaker: Jon
    content: "Okay. So, with... Wow! There were so many things that we just talked about. With talking about assembly line jobs becoming automated, that's using automation as a way of conflating robotics and AI; and the automation that happens might be algorithmic or it might be literal server motors and solenoids moving virtual hands in a factory space, that may or may not include AI, it might be as simple as an If-Else statement. And when we talk about the creative industry as being automated, well that's probably a little bit different. We might for fun, make a designer robot that sits there wearing a plaid shirt listening to Tycho, it's unlikely that it's gonna be that anthropomorphized. I can't speak recently."
  -
    timestamp: "0:07:29"
    speaker: Jon
    content: "And then when we talk about things like comedy, there's different things happening. There's using weird things that algorithms have generated as a source of humor itself, and then there's the algorithm being funny in a way that a human might expect. So if you have a very simple Twitterbot that is generating new words based on previous things it's seen, sometimes the machine gets it wrong and that's when things are pretty funny or you have a bot that samples through all of the words in the English dictionary and pre-fixes them with like \"Millennials are ruining,\" every noun, something like that. And so that's funny not because algorithmically it's funny or not because it has some deep semantic understanding of linguistics; it's just funny because millennials are ruining Buffalo Wild Wings or something like that. That's kinda funny in its randomness."

    content: "To me though, we can also solve creativity. What is creativity? What is comedy? Comedy is picking up disparate semantic concepts and linking them together in a way that makes you laugh. So I've been thinking a lot about puns. What are puns? Puns are ways of..."

    content: "My point is, at some level that's some kind of linguistic trick happening. And when there's a linguistic trick that works to one thing, it can probably work to another thing. And that's something that machine learning is pretty good at figuring out. So, to get a little bit technical for a second, there's a concept called 'word embedding'. Word embedding is a way of representing a bunch of different words in kind of geometric space. So, if you can imagine two axes, like an X and Y axes, you could represent say man, woman, king, queen on those axes. So, you could have the presenting gender as one axis and then you could have royalty on another axis. So you could scrub between the male or femaleness and the regalness. And so you could say, \"Man plus a bit of royalness is king,\" but then to the other side of the spectrum, on a gender spectrum, would be queen."

    content: "And I'll send links to all of these things. But so the idea is that if you... You probably can't represent the whole nuance of the English language on two dimensions like that. The cool thing about neural networks and machine learning is that you can represent things on like a gajillion dimensions, realistically with 100 to 300 dimensions, which you can't picture because you can't picture 300 dimensions, like it's... You can't do it in your head. But you can represent the whole nuance of the English language. So the point is that you can represent words and phrases in geometric space. Now to me, I don't think anyone's really solved it in this way, but a pun is just like a geometric mapping from one space to the other; we just have to figure out what that function is. But as soon as you do that, I think you'll have AI making better dad jokes than me."

    timestamp: "0:11:06"
    speaker: Matt
    content: "It does seem like we're at the phase of the things that can make you laugh are just a machine making a mistake and so it's absurd comedy. It seems like we could get to that logical... The kind of logical joke making like a joke teller, like a Steven Wright or like a Anthony Jeselnik where it's like... You take a route and then you make an unexpected turn but an unexpected logical turn as opposed to unexpected absurd turn, but that's not a thing I've seen yet, I think we're still at the thing Andy pointed out, which is probably like a Markov chain gone wrong, right?"
  -
    timestamp: "0:11:41"
    speaker: Andy
    content: "Well, there are a couple bots I'm thinking of that do specifically use neural networks. They're not just basically chopping and screwing language and hoping that it comes out funny. They're definitely not as rigorously structured as you just describe, Matt, but I think there's definitely more deep things happening than just kind of the \"Millennials have ruined Buffalo Wild Wings,\" kind of bots. So..."

So you talk to this bot and it'll, the more you talk to it, the more it learns about your mannerisms and how you talk. So it reflects kind of how you text, and then you can also I think connect it to your social media and so it'll ask you questions about things that it saw."

That's an interesting tool. But I think that, I don't know, chat UI is interesting to me, just moving away from kind of a digital interaction screen."
  -
    timestamp: "0:13:09"
    speaker: Matt
    content: "Can I just bring up one thing before we get too deep into it? It's just, we're talking about the idea of creativity. Should we define what that is, or why that's different than the assembly job thing? 'Cause I think, in my mind, maybe we're just discovering the assembly line was a really simple formula and a really simple if/then statement or whatever. Are we just gonna discover that creativity is just a more complicated formula but it's still a formula? I think about things like... I just say this 'cause I've been listening to too much Planet Money recently, but investment. There was a time where I think people might have thought that was a skill or a creative endeavor in the way that it requires a human to pick and have hunches. And in a similar way to most creative endeavors now, people kinda pretend like they're magic."
  -
    timestamp: "0:14:00"
    speaker: Matt
    content: "And then because people have spent so much time and money and energy trying to create computer programs to figure that out, we actually found that for the most part humans are actually pretty bad at investing; machines are a lot better at it. Or even just simple things like index funds are better at it. Are we just on that path and we'll find out, actually, you know what's better at designing? A robot running through this process like a million times whereas a person could run through it 100 times. It just seems like magic 'cause you're not actually looking at what's going on."
  -
    timestamp: "0:14:26"
    speaker: Andy
    content: "I think that's very possible. To me I think, what are the big differences between those two examples and something like design, is that you could very clearly know when you've done the correct thing. When the thing comes off the assembly line, and it's all together, and there's no problems with it, and when you make more money, then success is very clear. In our industry and so many other creative industries, we talk about robots making music or making visual art of something, success is not clear, right? The best you can do is just poll a million people and be like, \"Do you like this?\" And then... Or, \"Is this kind of solving the prompt?\" But even the prompt in our... Relative to music and visual art..."

Even though it might be a complicated series of things to get you to there, it's a pretty binary answer, if it went up or down, much like investing."

  -
    timestamp: "0:15:22"
    speaker: Andy
    content: "Yeah. To me I think it's kind of a slightly different conversation, because I would argue that anybody who's designing just to make a number go up is not really a designer. They're basically just doing a bad job of being a robot because I would certainly agree in that situation then yeah, just throw all the spaghetti at the wall and then go through and pick out the spaghetti that's stuck. But yeah, I..."

    timestamp: "0:15:44"

    timestamp: "0:15:54"
    speaker: Andy
    content: "So, to be clear, I'm not saying that there is something special and magical; there's not some mythical spark about designing or any other creativity. I do think that to put it in Jon's words, the array of all of the variables that you're considering when you're designing something is way more complex than the array of all the variables when you're trying to make a stock go up, or when you're trying to make a robot that puts this door on a car correctly."
  -
    timestamp: "0:16:19"
    speaker: Matt
    content: "But to my point, it might still be an array that is just more complex or many dimensions or whatever. It might still be that; it's just more complex than we know at the moment. But maybe some day we will know."
  -
    timestamp: "0:16:29"
    speaker: Andy
    content: "That I do agree with, and I think at a certain point the questions I have are... The design process to me, in most places, involves a certain type of work we call design. You're sitting down at your computer, you are making something look a certain way, you're creating a layout, you're designing a logo, you're making a poster, you're doing whatever it is that we maybe call the design work. But I think anybody that's worked for any amount of time knows that the job spans so far beyond that in terms of talking to people and figuring out what the actual problem is and what the prompt is. And I think in some ways, even if you could have an infinitely powerful super computer and map every single variable that matters in a design problem, the real problem then is like, \"All right, here's the 9,000 variables we need to get to put into the system,\" and those are not gonna be clear cut. That's gonna involve a huge amount of work talking to the client, and understanding the use case, and to get all the input, to actually put it into the system, to have it do its thing and spit out something."
  -
    timestamp: "0:17:30"
    speaker: Jon
    content: "I just have a feeling that the reason we haven't made much progress on design and AI thus far, design and machine learning thus far, is because in terms of the amount of money it makes, it's way, way less than for example high-frequency trading. High-frequency trading is pretty complex as you have to understand how the worlds work, you have to understand how markets work, you have to understand the relationship between news events and annual stock. And you have to do that like gagillion of times a second. Big finance makes a ton of money I don't know why, and that's why we've invested so much into it; or robotics, production lanes. Even the fact that for example in AutoCAD now or a bunch of Autodesks products now can do structural optimization algorithms that's way more complex than 2D product design. It just makes more money. So I don't think creativity's that that difficult. I think no one's just had the time and energy to explore it yet."
  -
    timestamp: "0:18:39"
    speaker: Matt
    content: "Or is it like, it's like we're... The example Andy used at the beginning where we have these social structures that allow a human to do it for less money than a computer; we're just at that point where a human will do it for less money than a computer 'cause it costs too much money to make a computer do it."
  -
    timestamp: "0:18:52"
    speaker: Jon
    content: "For now, for now. I seriously think we're close. Some AI projects that have been interesting me recently are like synthesizing photographs from text description. So you can type, \"Show me a photo of a yellow budgie in front of a green tree wearing a San Francisco 49ers baseball cap.\" That last bit was probably a little bit too much actually, but you can... And then it will go and generate a photograph for you from nothing, like it hallucinates a photograph; it's completely wild."
  -
    timestamp: "0:19:26"
    speaker: Andy
    content: "But that doesn't even resemble creativity in my mind; that's not a thing I would even describe as creative. I don't disagree, I just think that the only thing that we disagree about is I think the scale of the problem is much greater than it sounds like either of you think it is."

    speaker: Annie
    content: "I think also like we keep talking about this idea of creativity too, this fear that AI is going to somehow crack the nut on what creativity is, but I also think the design is creative in a sense but there's a lot of intangible. I think we're concentrating on the machine learning kind of taking care of all the artifacts of what we produce, but I don't know if it could... I think it might just change our design process but I don't know necessarily if it will actually replace us. I think we will just have to use our skills in a different way. I can already see just like the work that Jon's been doing at Airbnb like from React to Sketch is really interesting because there's a lot of... The Fast Company, that Fast Co. '5 design jobs that won't exist in the future', there is a lot of work that is downstream that I can see AI taking care of. And I don't think that's necessarily scary because there's a lot of stuff, like I don't wanna make 600 variations of a layout when I know a machine can do this a lot faster."
  -
    timestamp: "0:20:52"
    speaker: Annie
    content: "I'm more interested in solving the problem further up the stream and not necessarily always being at the tail end doing a bunch of iterations on something when ultimately a lot of these problems... And we are talking specific about screen-based and apps and digital work. A lot of these problems to a certain extent have been solved before. That's why... We're also the most complex AI, right? As a UX designer you've solved a problem, you can probably scale it to your next job so technically you are your own best AI tool. And so I can see that machine learning taking care of a lot of that stuff. So I don't know if that's a different conversation but I don't know if it will take care of... I don't know if we can outsource creativity per se but I do see the value of AI and machine learning maybe taking care of a lot of stuff that is kind of a chore for us. I see a lot of potential there."

I'm sure we'll be past that soon; just moving up the chain of complexity until which point we're just talking about, \"Okay, what part of that whole thing was creative?\" and now are we at the top where you're coming up with the initial idea, is that... Can a machine replicate that or not? Which I think Jon and I seem to be saying that we think it can at some point and maybe not. Maybe it's not as complex as we think."

    content: "I think there's scales of design and there's the whole creative process. I think we'll get there and we're trying to get there, but that's also like, that's one tiny facet of it. There is so much design that happens that doesn't really need to happen. There's so much production work, there's no much dragging rectangles for reasons that are non-creative. Let's take an example. You're designing a screen on IOS and then you wanna see what it will look like in material design. You can do it and it's just gonna be a ton of rectangles to drag to get there."

So I think that's a lot of the design process that just doesn't need to happen, and I think there's a ton of the actual, the fun stuff that we will be empowered to do when we have... And this is just low level automation, this is stuff we're trying to work on Airbnb. When we get these rote tasks done and kind of taken care of, then we can spend more time focusing on the interesting stuff whether or not the interesting stuff gets augmented by AI as well, it kind of doesn't matter."

    content: "While you're pulling that up, I do wanna say that I definitely am also not afraid of this potential future where AI has \"taken over the design process\" because frankly I don't see it as any different than any other tool. And I know that some AI people, maybe Jon included, would take issue with that, but I think it's something that we will still ultimately use, and use however we want. And a comparison I always think of is when photography was invented, a lot of people were like, \"We're done painting. Why bother painting anymore? We have photographs. That's all we need to capture images, and so we're gonna do a portrait or something.\" Or, \"Any of these things we were doing with paintings before, we'll just take a picture.\" And that was the whole impetus for modernism and the making painting actually interesting, where before that it was just people trying to paint an apple as good as they could possibly paint an apple. So I know it's very different to have a camera versus a neural network that has more nodes and power than a human brain, but ultimately I think that more tools just means that people can do more and are freed up to possibly break out of expectations that we've already set for ourselves."

    content: "And again I think there's just like a range of things. There are humans doing things which are essentially a fault loop, and we fixed that in industry, we fixed that on assembly lines by replacing that with robot arms and stuff, and we're fixing it with design tools now. There's also just using the computer as a really interesting exploratory tool. As an example, this... I think I've sent the right video over, and I guess you wanna mute as you scrub through it. Just click around it and you can see what's going on there. This is a paper where you give a text description, and it hallucinates an image from scratch. And the images aren't great resolution right now. They'll get better as technology gets better. But to be able to go from a text description to a user interface, or a UI concept, that's not that far out. I genuinely think that you could say, \"Hey, I'm a designer at Airbnb. I wanna see a settings page for our host to manage the availability and the pricing of their listing.\" And we should be able to synthesize a pretty decent exploration of a UI from that."

I have kind of confidence that we just need the right data, and we need to ask the right questions, but then we'll have it porting over to aid the creative process. But it's also this idea of aiding the creative process. Whatever we do, it's just a new tool. As soon as guitars got amplifiers, we started using the amplifiers for the weird stuff they do. Amplifiers distort. That wasn't a thing that was intended, that was an interesting side effect, and then heavy metal got invented because of that. You just have new tools..."

Here's a desktop website, and here it is in responsive, in a mock up.\" I'm really interested in freeing up what design actually means, and that it isn't always the tangible artifact that we show. I'm really curious about... I would love to find someone who's working on all the Google Home or Alexa, all those designers. How do you design a conversation with someone? That is really fascinating to me. How do you tell people about that, and where do you even begin?

The other thing I think when I think about all these things is how far down the line of all of the jobs that you could potentially automate, creative and otherwise, and all of the things you could do to have a return on your research and investment, it seems to me like we'd be so far down that line that the world will be such a different place by the time we would be doing anything that resembles automated design that it's almost not even worth talking about because at that point, have we eliminated the need for human labor? Are we all philosopher kings and queens that are just sitting around all day, pontificating? What do you people think about that? The idea that..."

It is almost entirely, vast, vast majority advertising.

I think that's not because that's what the industry is, it's just because people have applied creativity to a situation to make something interesting and novel. But at the point where we're talking about automating these things... There are certain design things that's hard for me to imagine automating, but as we're talking about it, I'm also certain there are lots of, what some people will call design decisions that essentially are automated, in the sense that human input is not valued when you're deciding what it is.

And it probably didn't feel magical in the way we're describing because it wasn't like you said, \"Robot, make me an Amazon website,\" and it just spat it out.

Well, what we're assuming is the capitalists and factory owners are benevolent, and I think thousands of years of history have shown us that well, capitalists probably aren't gonna do anything for the public good unless forced to. So there's a political question there as well. How do we make sure that this redistribution of wealth happens? Because what I think is, likely is that, \"Hey, we have this solution. The solution is universal basic income.\" That is the solution as far as I can see. The problem is how do we get that? How do we make sure that the wealth gets redistributed towards that?

So it's gonna be a long time before we can agree that everyone deserves to just live a life. If you look just from World War I to now, the sheer amount of resources in capital and things that are automated, there should be hundreds of thousands if not millions of people that don't need to work and can just chill, and yet they're not 'cause we invented middle management and we invented all these other things because the very fundamental cellular level of our society is based on this idea of capitalism and that your self-worth comes from work.

I know we could get technical 'cause Jon could probably describe some technical things here but I think I wanna talk about this more just theoretically. My question is, when you are making something with a neural network or an AI that is, let's say, a little fuzzy as to whether or not it's successful. Lt's talk about music, which is the example of the podcast that Jon sent us before this which we can put in the show notes. When you're making something like music and you're basically trying to make a neural network that makes interesting music and kind of invents it out of effectively thin air or from a really deep source material that kind of represents all of humans history of music, my question is, the art that I have always found the most meaningful to me has without exception never been the most popular thing, right?"

    content: "There is pop music, there is music that most people like; and it's not that I hate that, I'm not some hipster, that's fine. But that's not the music that's most meaningful to me. And you could say the same for literature, you could say the same for design, you could say the same for visual art. The things that have had the most resonance and impact for me have never been the things that everyone loves a whole lot. And so the thing that I'm trying to understand is how we can program these networks to make interesting work and not just spit out the gray average of what everyone is interested in or finds valuable in a world where it's hard to evaluate the success of a system like that."

If you want something that's gonna optimize towards people refreshing your newsfeed or clicking the big green 'buy' button, that's one thing that we could converge to and then we'll probably converge design. If you just wanna do interesting stuff, that's another thing that you can just ask for. There was a really, really great article by this guy Samim about using evolutionary algorithms to come up with interesting riffs and drum beats and stuff like that in Ableton Live. It uses... Evolutionary algorithms are a lot like... Oh god, we're getting technical."

That's how you get bland results. Now, this was a really interesting experiment because he was using a variation of that called Novelty Search. Novelty Search is basically evolving away from conformity so it's just saying, \"If things are converging, let's go in the other direction.\" And he came up with some really cool interesting, weird music. I think that's the role of designer is conductor, composer in harmony with machines to be like, \"I'm a unique snowflake, show me stuff that's unique.\""

So Simon, my husband, has been kind of talking about designers as conductors now, and I think that's an interesting framework to think about what we actually do and moving forward is, we are conducting, we are kind of using the tools that we have to produce ultimately what our vision is. And I still, I don't know if AI can create something that is meaningful but I don't... I'm not against it. I'll believe it... What is it? I'll see it when I believe it, I guess. Who knows?

Just scrubbing through the video that Jon had sent over about like, \"I wanna see a blue cat,\" or whatever. Just all of those errors, I find that extremely meaningful because it shows flaws and it shows kind of how vulnerable that process is; and I think that's incredibly meaningful. I don't know if you can scale that to an entire movie but I think there's potential there."

I get that. What I think is important about art is that good art oftentimes for me has given me something I never would've thought to ask for. I never would have thought to think to ask for this particular thing, and instead I'm getting a perspective that is the result of an entire person's life. Every experience they've had in some way contributes to this thing they've made. They're referencing things from their childhood, they're referencing thoughts they've had in idle moments. They're referencing all of these things when they pull it together and really make something in a way that the sheer vastness of the variables there... I guess what I'm really saying is that I think that I can imagine a future where neural networks are spitting out all kinds of creative work that will be very interesting."

    speaker: Andy
    content: "I have a hard time imagining a world where the creative work they're spitting out is indistinguishable and/or replaces the creative work of humans, just because I feel like the unique perspective that any creator brings to something is always going to have this kind of not worth emulating importance. Yes, you could hypothetically load up a neural network with every single thought I've ever had and everything I've ever seen and then see what kinds of things it'd spit out; but the collection of that data, the organization of it is just never gonna be worth it when instead you have this other repository of information to use. And so I imagine a world where there's human comedians and they tell certain types of jokes, and there's robot comedians and they tell certain types of jokes, and those things kind of maybe don't overlap as much as we think they would."

    content: "What if what makes creativity valuable isn't the consumption of it? It isn't that you've had all of these experiences and you've remixed them in a way that is interesting to me. What if it's the fact that you've created it? What if the flow that you get from the creative process is what defines and what make it interesting? And that's not something that can be replaced unless you have a one-click 'make art' button. As long as we are creating, I think the work will inherently have value because my friend's labor and my friend's ideas have value and whether or not those have been augmented with machines, that's valuable to me."

    content: "But I can also picture a world where it's... Maybe part of why it's meaningful is because you identified with it and you discovered it and you ascribe some meaning to it. I can see that world where what if it is... Maybe it's not the, you hit a button and you get exactly what you need, but you find something amongst this generated music or whatever and you ascribe meaning to it because this series of random things came together and it's indistinguishable for something else that you may have discovered 20 years ago, right?"
  -
    timestamp: "0:49:44"
    speaker: Andy
    content: "Sure, I think that happens currently in regular creative work, right? Like I will ascribe meaning to things that the creator didn't intend. It's one of the most beautiful things I think about doing any kind of creative work. But I think there's just a depth to every decision that's made when you're, say, making a movie and you're the writer and director. And every decision you make could be inspired by something that... Is just a little piece of this overall work but it itself actually has an entire depth to it. Maybe you want this character to say this thing because it's a line from some fairytale that you remember from growing up, and I never heard that fairytale, so I'm not gonna get the reference, I'm not gonna understand the fairytale, but the fact that that line has these deep roots in this thing and meant something to somebody else is gonna be translated in a way that makes it more meaningful than if it was just a random string that I also would have no relationship to. I just... I don't know."

We're working on a tool right now where you sketch a wireframe and it turns it into a real app with real code. Now, it's kinda cool; the problem is that everyone draws wireframes slightly differently. People draw images in different ways. People squiggle out text in slightly different ways so we're making it now so it also learns from everyone but it also specifically learns about how you like to draw wireframes. And then you have a custom shop tool that's built to how your brain works, and similar things could happen with things that empower creativity."

It's just like, \"Oh, yeah, I'm recognizing things about that.\" And some things might be unexpected and challenging, but at the core of most things is, you get it. It is familiar to you. And so, the question I began this whole thing with was, basically, I don't wanna end up with every movie being a summer blockbuster movie because those are the ones that sell the best and the ones that most people like because they're the least offensive. And the idea that, basically, you have an AI that was making your personal summer blockbuster movie that maybe no one else likes, but we know for sure you're gonna like reliably..."

I don't know if I'm phrasing it correctly, but..."

    timestamp: "0:55:01"

    content: "Well, but that's what I was gonna say is that both on an individual level and I think on a wider cultural level, every once and a while something comes along that if you'd fed it into the machine and said, \"Will this work? Will this individual, will all these people like this?\" the machine would've said, \"Certainly not. There's no evidence in all of our millions of points of data that anyone would ever like this,\" and then people like it. I think we've all seen a movie or seen a painting or listened to a song that was in some way totally unfamiliar. You would've never thought it was possible. The only example I can think of that's even close is the movie Upstream Color. When I saw that movie, I never would have thought to have asked for that movie. If you described it, I probably would've said, \"I don't think I'm gonna like that.\" And yet it was an amazing movie that I totally loved, that I can't imagine any kind of automated system that is just trying to learn from the past, is going to ever spit that out at me, or on a wider cultural level, spit out the new movie that changes what a summer blockbuster could be, or totally defies the paradigm."

What are the actual underlying explanations for these things that we're never really gonna be able to put our fingers on for our audiences? The fact that there's a fuzzy measure of success means that there is this possibility to come along and really make something novel. The other dumb example I can think of is, right now, the most popular video game on Steam, is this video game, where you create a dad and then go on dates with other dads. It's a dad dating sim, which defies everything anyone ever would have thought about a blockbuster video game, right?"
