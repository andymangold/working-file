    content: "Yeah, well, that's a relevant introduction. Now people have a good sense for your dynamic, it feels friendly, we're really coming through the air waves to people and just getting right in their living room with them. Alright. Well tonight, we're gonna be discussing all sorts of topics around the idea of getting a job. And specifically, Victoria has mentioned that she and Daisy have a history in their careers of applying for a job that maybe on paper, they don't 100% meet the qualifications for and then learning on the job presumably to get to the point where you are in fact, qualified and can do the job in which you've been hired to do. And there's all kinds of ideas wrapped up in that. Maybe the best way to start is just to, from Daisy first, just hear what your career path has been. For people that don't know you, what Daisy do? "

    timestamp: "0:03:55"
    speaker: Daisy
    content: "What do Daisy do? I can tell you my tale of well... Well, I did not major in anything remotely close, well close-ish, to graphic design. I majored in industrial design, which basically meant a lot of time in a wood shop, getting woodchips in all the crevices on my body. And..."

    speaker: Victoria
    content: "It's true."
  -
    timestamp: "0:04:17"
    speaker: Daisy
    content: "It's just... It was a lot. And I don't know. There's not a whole lot of jobs available that involved getting woodchips in all the crevices of your body. People don't generally pay you for that. And... [chuckle]"

    timestamp: "0:04:33"
    speaker: Victoria
    content: "Not the kinds you were looking for."
  -
    timestamp: "0:04:34"
    speaker: Daisy
    content: "Not the kinds I was looking for. There are a lot of jobs actually. Craigslist is a good place to look. But towards the end of senior year, you just do a panic and realize that you have no marketable skills whatsoever, and just apply to every single little thing that shows up in your inbox, and that's what I did."

    timestamp: "0:04:52"
    speaker: Matt
    content: "And so where did you end up working out of school? And are you still working there now? What are the jobs you've had?"

    timestamp: "0:04:58"
    speaker: Daisy
    content: "I have had four jobs in four years. So we'll see if I keep that record up. I started out working at this horrific switch up of a place that was consultants in Waltham, Massachusetts and it did most of its work in China, so it was really not a..."
  -
    timestamp: "0:05:19"
    speaker: Victoria
    content: "It was educational. It was getting kids to go to international schools or something."

    timestamp: "0:05:24"

    content: "Doing okay. And you were doing what for them?"

    timestamp: "0:05:31"

    content: "I was doing nominally web design for them. But in practice..."

    speaker: Victoria
    content: "See that, I didn't know."
  -
    timestamp: "0:05:39"
    speaker: Daisy
    content: "Yeah, I see. But in practice, it just meant making lots of shitty brochures and email templates, and whatever else they wanted to throw at us. We were in fake marketing and design department that really didn't do anything legitimate whatsoever. So..."
  -
    timestamp: "0:06:02"
    speaker: Andy
    content: "So, overall, a good experience then. Very positive."
  -
    timestamp: "0:06:04"
    speaker: Daisy
    content: "Oh yeah, super positive, super positive. A lot of it was just sort of nobody there really knew how to make a good website or a good printed material, or..."

    content: "Deep burns coming from Victoria over here."
  -
    timestamp: "0:06:25"
    speaker: Daisy
    content: "Yep, no, I'm super used to this, unfortunately. So, in terms of learning on the job there, that was just sort of spending a lot of time trying to go backwards and get the graphic design education that I didn't really have, just by looking at websites and looking at work that I did like and just trying to get somewhere halfway competent with that."
  -
    timestamp: "0:06:51"
    speaker: Andy
    content: "So am I correct in assuming that maybe the way that you got this job, despite not having formally studied graphic design or web design at all was just that these people also didn't know how to make websites? "

    timestamp: "0:07:01"
    speaker: Daisy
    content: "Correct."

    timestamp: "0:07:06"

  -
    timestamp: "0:07:12"

    speaker: Andy
    content: "I bet it wasn't that bad."
  -
    timestamp: "0:07:21"
    speaker: Daisy
    content: "So it had maybe one or two pieces that were sort of graphic design related and then the rest of it was just like blocks of wood put in various shapes."

The other thing I wanna say is that you mentioned that while you were working at Wayfair, you were very much like emulating work that you knew to be good even if maybe the underpinnings weren't there for this critical thought behind it or the process behind the work. And I think you know this, but to point out to our listeners, that's how everybody learns how to design. When you're a student, you do that, if you're in school, when you're early in your career, you do that because before you learn how to do anything the \"right way\", you always start by emulating. So I thought you kinda said that with a derogatory sense of like, \"Oh, I was just copying work I thought that was good but... \""

And also, just in my time in school, the graphic design department, they were so intimidating and it felt like the way that they talked about it, maybe this was just at my school and where Daisy also went to school, they talked about graphic design like it was something that no one else could possibly fathom, all the so many things that they knew.

So stuff like that. Oh, and lipstick packaging. She gasps because I would sometimes take the lipsticks, with permission, and give them to my friends. Yeah. It just felt like even though I was earning very little money and that was not sustainable, I was just like, hey, if I can get a job anywhere doing graphic design work when I have no training doing graphic design work, just like my letters that I draw for funds and what I've taught myself, and also, most of the jobs that I will want in the future will also be in New York, so I decided to move there for that one really low paying job and give myself a year. So I did that and it was just this revelation of... Even though it was pittance, like, \"Someone is paying me for design.\" And I did, like Daisy mentioned, feel like I could take those things and really swing my way into a better job the next time.

The one job that I would want, that wasn't in the New York, huh?\" So that was really... I can't really take credit for that.

Maybe they'd just studied a little bit of computer science in college but they hadn't really gotten any real world development in any of their courses. We've taken on employees like that with the understanding that we are not gonna expect you to be able to work at the same level as a full-fledged know-what-you're-doing person for a long time, but we still sort of value your perspective, and we value having to teach somebody and value the potential that we could invest in this person."

It's gonna line up perfectly. I've got all the skills\" or did you feel a sense of doubt and you weren't necessarily qualified for it? "

So this is probably gonna be a really difficult interview process.\" I think what I found out is that there are a lot of interns that work at graphic design firms and then cycle through really quickly. I think I was in the door pretty quickly without a whole lot of thought. I don't think it was all that rigorous that they were like, \"We have to make sure that your qualifications are X.\" They were like, \"I don't know. You might be here for three months and then you're gone.\" I think the intimidating part was getting there and being like, \"Oh. There's a lot of important stuff going on and nobody knows who I am and nobody even seems to care that much that I'm here. Huh. I better do some good work and stick around a little bit.\" The New York internship thing, I think it's just known that you might be here for a second. There's not a huge commitment here.

So this question is for Daisy, too, whoever wants to kinda jump in. What was missing from the higher education experience that sort of made you feel like the things you were skilled to do but there were no jobs in? Was it just that no one told you that it's very difficult to make it as a freelance illustrator or that no one told you that there're very few jobs for woodblock shape maker..."

I think from talking to people, my peers, when I was going through college, I think that was a very similar experience. Either I picked the wrong thing, \"Oops.\" And the sort of... The thing about college is that for better or worse, it puts you on a track for the time you're there and it feels like if you just do the next thing in line, the next domino will fall, and you'll continue progressing which I think makes it very easy if you end up on the wrong track, you'll be like, \"Well, at least it's a track,\" and you just kinda keep chugging along."

And then you get to school and you spend a lot of money, and then somebody says to you, \"Oh, my 12-year-old niece can totally do that, it is totally a graphic designer.\" And you kind of have to swing the pendulum really far the other way as a reactionary measure to be like, \"No, no, no, no, this is super difficult, not everyone can do this, you have to be trained for eight years in a monastery to be able to lay things out on a grid.\""

    content: "I mean, it is. And I will say from my position in the graphic design world, I always felt kind of like the opposite. I felt like any fine art thing, you needed some undefinable spark. You needed a voice of a thing you had, you wanted to say in order to do that well, which I never felt like I had. I grew up drawing. I ended up at art school because I loved drawing and painting and sculpture. But I was just good at drawing in the sense that like you plop some fruit on a table and I could take a pencil and make it really look like that fruit on a piece of paper. That was what I was good at. I never felt like I had whatever this magical thing was that made people able to make this art that had this deeper meaning and expression, I felt like I was lacking this spark."
  -
    timestamp: "0:35:54"

You don't have to bring some magical perspective or interesting voice, all you have to do is, here's a problem, can you solve it with shapes, and colors and type?\" Which to me gave me that missing piece that I felt like I didn't have in the fine art world."

And one of the reasons, like I said, is just the history of design and the things that are taught as the important foundational ideas are very myopic. They're coming from a very specific culture. It's not just white male culture, it's also western culture. It's also Modernism and all the ideas that are contained in that morass. And all of these things are treated as if they are the one true way. This is the graphic design way. This is how you do it correctly. And it's sometimes oblivious to the greater world context around it, and all sorts of vectors."

Not everyone went and made a sculpture in their senior year at some point. And so, it just felt like whenever we had to do that, I was so uncomfortable because I'm like, \"Ugh, I know that someone else knows the correct way to do this, and I don't.\" And I would ask my friends in graphic design, \"Please, please help me. Did I pick the right... \" I don't know. It's just a very nervous habit. I don't know, I don't like to be wrong."

A pretty big group of the population ends up doing something over the course of their schooling or career that you could say resembles graphic design. Somebody will make a PowerPoint presentation for their big talk at the insurance company, or people will make a flyer or an email template. Things that are supposed to be \"graphic design work,\" but lots of people can do, which in some ways makes the profession more accessible. But you're saying basically because you were at some point forced to do graphic design, you were put under pressure to do this thing well, which kind of shined a light on the fact that you didn't study it, felt like you couldn't do it well.

And writing the requirements for a job, especially in any kind of industry that has any kind of creative hint to it or creative kind of bend to it, is so so difficult. Because what you really just want to write is we just want somebody that cares and is good at this, and you can't write \"cares\" and \"is good at this\" in job requirements, it doesn't really translate."

Does that mean 10 years of experience?\" And the real answer is that there are people with one year of experience that are amazing at this thing because they took to it very naturally and their experience was very helpful and they learned from somebody very good. And there are people with 10 years of experience that are still terrible at the thing they do because they never care and never tried to get better and have been in a bad job with no good mentorship. So it's very difficult to write that down. And that applies to everything."

I just care that the outcome is something that works for us. So, I have never been frustrated at somebody who applied for a job where they didn't meet the requirements for it when it was a job description that I wrote because I often felt like, I just need to write this job description to appeal to the person that I'm trying to speak to, not to select them from an advanced search query where I can somehow describe all their life experience and qualifications that will pick out the exact right people."

They were like, \"Can you build an e-commerce website?\" We were like, \"Absolutely we can build one of those. It's what?

But if I have 20 minutes to present before a panel of people who don't actually know anything about the work previously, they generally are really positive about it.

One of the big reasons I think I ended up the way I did is that I always had 110% support from my parents growing up in every creative thing I ever tried to do.

A lot of the times, the way it comes out is to preface and talk about all the ways that either the thing I'm presenting is maybe not up to par, or the interview won't go well, or whatever, and I would just say skip that part. I don't think it's conscious but I think you'll see that in a lot of people, they're just like, \"Okay. Before I get into this, I need to tell you this, this, this, and this.\" And..."

You may not give us context because you will either undermine yourself or you provide context that will not be there to support the work in the real world, and that's useless."

    timestamp: "0:58:47"

    timestamp: "0:59:56"
    speaker: Victoria
    content: "I just wanted to say, what I was saying before about how heavily the lines are drawn in between what you study in college and I feel like we're told in just quite speaking tones, inside voices, like, \"It doesn't matter in design what your major is.\" But then there are megaphones everywhere that everyone can hear and see that are like, \"Your major is your life forever.\" So, I so, so, so wish that someone had emphasized to me while I was studying that I could do whatever because that would've saved me a lot of angst. I figured it out pretty quick, but there were a bad couple of years where I didn't like what I was doing and I didn't know how I was going to get to do what I wanted to do, and I wish someone had told me that I could."

    content: "Yeah, I think something that has helped me feel more confident and have more confidence in the work I'm doing is reminding myself that none of what we're doing is actually that hard. Obviously, it requires training and we have an area of expertise, and our expertise should be valued and we should be paid lots of money for it, and etcetera, but there's nothing out there that is so mystical that it's impossible to be learned. You can learn everything on your own, you don't have to go to a super expensive snooty school to have the skill set to do what you're doing. So just, dog with thumbs."
