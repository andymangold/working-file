    content: "Exactly. Alright, so one of the things we have listed here was the idea of open source design, and specifically this references Google's Material Design handbook or even something like Twitter Bootstrap. I think the sort of episode here was gonna kinda be about this idea that more and more of these kind of libraries basically for just making a site or a... Basically Google's design... Material Design style guide is more or less like a style guide you would have for a brand, but they're saying, \"Make all web apps and products like this and follow these sort of standards.\" And I've noticed that I see a lot of people that are either... They're developers, maybe, by trade and they don't consider themselves designers, maybe it's a company that can't afford to hire a designer, but just adopt this style across the board. I didn't know if other people had similar experiences and seen lots of Google Material Design-ey things popping up or if they had seen Twitter Bootstrap all over the place and felt like it was having an effect on the design world and how we perceive product design these days. Maurice, why don't you start. Have you had any... What are your thoughts on the idea of, \"Here's a free design for someone who wants to apply it to their product kind of blindly.\""
  -
    timestamp: "06:45"
    speaker: "Maurice"
    content: "I generally don't have an issue with that, at least it gives some clients somewhere to start with if they just have no idea where to start, in terms of a design aesthetic. It's funny, you're talking about open source design and the first thing I thought about was WordPress because it is technically pretty open source and it's something where certainly I feel like it's influenced how websites are built. It certainly has influenced what clients expect from websites, they figure every website is a WordPress website and that it should have the same kind of functionality and all that sort of stuff. I generally don't have a problem with that. As long as it gives you, I think, a starting point, it's good. I don't know if it should be the finishing line, though."
  -
    timestamp: "07:31"
    speaker: "Matt"
    content: "I don't really have... I feel like I would have approached this a couple years ago as like some sort of... In some ways it must be wrong, or in some ways it should have to justify itself, but more recently I've just found it as a shortcut for people understanding things more than probably the way I might have taken it previously, which is, \"This is replacing the work of designers and doing a bad job of it.\" Specifically in the Material Design sense, where it's like, \"Oh, everyone understands what a tab bar is now, and they all know how to use it the same.\" And I don't just mean designers know how to use it the same, I mean users know how to use it the same. Maybe this is actually a really good thing, it can be like a jumping point for making decisions if you're not... If you're not making something wild and new and some totally new interaction, lean on something that people understand and don't be... You don't have to spend a million years trying to come up with a totally new way to do the exact same thing that everybody else is doing if you are doing what everybody else is doing."

    content: "Yeah."
  -
    timestamp: "08:34"
    speaker: "Linda"
    content: "My experience was like sets of rules in general, or that... It's very difficult to get a non-designer, non-product-thinking person on board with the fact that, \"Okay, here are your list of rules. By the way, these rules are gonna change. We're not gonna know when or why, but they will. And [chuckle] so here. Learn them very, very well and then be expected for everything to be pulled out from underneath you at any moment.\" I think that any design language or any brand or identity system, it needs to be this set of rules that everybody follows and everybody agrees, \"Yes, this the word,\" until it's not anymore and until it needs to change slightly. And I think that that's one of the issues that I have with this, is that it's not the most nimble way to work, with especially such large systems 'cause if you're trying to get the whole world on board with the idea that this thing's gonna change, that's tricky."
  -
    timestamp: "09:38"
    speaker: "Matt"
    content: "Well, the way I see it is more... It's not that we need to get everybody on board with the rules. It's like there are probably some people who are totally happy thinking through these problems and solving them in their own way, and then there are some people who maybe just have no desire to do so or don't have time or maybe don't have... Don't see themselves as designers in a way that they can do this effectively, so there's a toolkit for them to do it as opposed to it just being a mess."

  -
    timestamp: "10:08"
    speaker: "Andy"
    content: "Yeah, I think in its most... The most optimistic take on it is the kind of perspective Matt is painting here, where, yes, if everybody is gonna be making groups of radio buttons and drop downs and date/time selects and tab bars, it's really nice to have some kind of centralized, and we can all generally agree like, \"Yeah, this is pretty much how this should work, and there's good reasons for why they work that way.\" I do think there's some unintended knock-on effects, though. The best thing I can cite is that I can't tell you how many times I've had either a client or some other project we've been working on, I've seen some documentation for things and somebody has said, \"Here's the color palette for our projects.\" And it's just they took the whole rainbow color palette from Google Design and just dropped it..."

    speaker: "Andy"
    content: "Just dropped it in, like, \"Here's the 48 colors we're gonna use,\" and it's just the full, saturated rainbow. I do feel like little things like that, I feel like the color palette of the web has taken this kind of very normie, saturated, bright and happy kind of bend since Material Design came out. I'm not sure if that's just me projecting or if there actually is some difference in the colors people are using, but little things like that, I do think... There's no reason for them to standardize colors, right? That's the kind of thing where... That's not broken. There's no meaningful purpose to have a kind of standard there the same there is for a date selector, a tab bar. [chuckle] That's just them saying like, \"Hey, we picked some pretty colors for you 'cause we are gonna do your job for you.\" And the result is that, yeah, more people just use the bright blue and the nice green buttons, but it's interesting 'cause I feel like lots of people just don't think about the idea of the colors they use on their product being part of their identity anymore because this is just what we do now. We all have candy colors on our websites."

    content: "Again, in some ways... In some ways I can see that, in other ways like the... I don't know, there's the color coding to create in a more effective button, like bright red delete button or a big green save button. In some ways I can't get too mad at that 'cause you're like, \"Well, I'm just trying to make it pretty easy to spot that in a sea of buttons and I don't really care what your brand colors are. That makes my life easier,\" is the guy trying to use it."

    speaker: "Linda"
    content: "If only the web were just a black-and-white old-timey talkie. What if Material Design was just black and white, and if you want colors, you gotta make 'em yourself?"

    content: "I'm always trying to make all websites black and white. Frere-Jones is the one company that let us talk 'em into doing it, and I'm very happy with that site. I think black and white is great, and you do need a third color sometimes for a little warning flash message pretty much. But yeah. Yeah, so I don't know. That's kinda my feeling about it. I agree with you, Matt, that I think maybe more like four or five years ago I would've been at least critical of this for, like you said, trying to do the job of design, but doing it badly. And now, for lack of a better word, I'm just much more practical and I understand that the people that are going to copy-and-paste the Google colors, the Google Material Design colors palette and just use that as the palette for their company and use this as the Bible for designing their product, they weren't hiring designers in the first place. They were just gonna have a really poorly designed product before because they didn't think about anything, and now at least they're gonna get some of that... Some of those easiest hurdles, they're gonna clear with a guide like this."

  -
    timestamp: "13:51"
    speaker: "Andy"
    content: "Yeah. Sure. And I do think that there's something too, part of the conversation here is just about the fact that this stuff is actually open sourced. You can't steal Material Design. If you copy it, you're just doing what they intended for you to do. You're supposed to use it. And the same goes for Twitter Bootstrap. I assume the same goes for a lot of design stuff. With WordPress, I know that WordPress technology-wise is open source. I'm not sure how the themes work, depending on who made them, I'm sure it changes. But yeah, the fact that it's actually... People are distributing design as a commodity, like a literal physical commodity, is an interesting difference too that is really only possible now because of... We're starting to not only settle on a shared language in the abstract sense, where we're all working in the same space and we look at the same products and so we're starting to understand how things work and should look together."
  -
    timestamp: "14:40"
    speaker: "Andy"
    content: "We're also literally documenting that and making it available for free, open source to people that want it, which in the software world is always very appealing to me because it's like the formalization of your transparency and the formalization of this shared sense of where you are as a community. And we actually have it designed now too, which I think is kind of interesting. I do think the implementations of it thus far are a little bit sterile. Like, \"Yeah, here's the color palette, here's the tab bar.\" To me, that's the most boring thing you can do, but it's a step down the right path of us actually thinking about the way we build things and make things in the world, on the web especially."

There are few people trying to solve this problem at the same time, and a lot of bigger companies even have their own internal teams building internal tools that do these things.

When I first learned about version control, it was like this beautiful... It was eight years ago or whatever, this sheet was lifted from my eyes and I was like, \"Of course! Why would you ever just save files and lose all the old versions and every time you press command S, it's exactly equal to every other time you press command S. It just makes so much sense.\" So I have no doubt that there will be more robust, better version control for design files just as I think there's going to be for literally everything, because making this kind of technology intuitive and understandable to people, there's so much upside and it just makes so much sense when you're working with computers in any meaningful way.

But I just kinda, I don't even really pay it any mind because you may be able to take the concept, but the one thing that you won't be able to replicate is what I bring to the table, the unique thing that I bring to the project, my work ethic to the project, the way that I approach it. You may try to do something similar, but it's not the same kind of thing. So I just sit back and watch this person do what they do, and other people have brought it to their attention and he's done the exact same thing, blocked them on Twitter, talked about them disparagingly, etcetera. And the fact that this person has done this several times with other people moreso just shows their own immaturity, but personally I don't really think anything of it. I'm somewhat flattered by it, but not to the point where it's taking money out of my pocket so I don't really care."

You could steal the motel site right now and you'd take all of our colors and our shapes and whatever, and our people, maybe put your own people in there, but what would that do for you?

And they probably don't have any good future prospects if this is how they're gonna go about producing creative things in the world.

We would be direct messaging each other about it and just really hating on this person.

And I still get stuff sent to me every now and then where somebody is like, \"Hey, I just thought you should know,\" and then they show me a picture of something that was clearly inspired by something I had made at some point, but I just let it slide.

    content: "Yeah, and I also just wanna build on what Maurice was saying in that if somebody rips you off, it's okay to feel a little upset about it, but let it go because that person does not have the brain inside your head that led them to an original thought. And I've worked with a lot of freelancers at this point where you hire somebody, you give them a prompt for something that they need to work on, and it's obvious right away if they're able to produce their own original ideas. And the people who do a really great job at that and very clearly have their own voice and their own illustration style, I hire them over and over and over again. And yeah, sometimes you hire somebody and it's just... It's clear that they can't really think on their own, and those people, you're just like, \"Well thanks for your time.\" [chuckle] So it works itself out."
  -
    timestamp: "27:58"
    speaker: "Andy"
    content: "Yeah, I do think... I think one of the things that led me to want to be a creative person in any sense, originally, like a \"artist\" and then eventually a designer, was because I just really liked making stuff. I was kind of... I had this affection and warmth for the things I had made. I was proud of them and they felt dear to me, and I think that feeling that makes you so badly want to defend yourself and be so hurt when someone blatantly steals your thing because it sullies it, it was so special, this thing you made with your own brain and hands and heart, and now it's just... Someone just copied and pasted and put it on their tote bag or whatever, and that just feels bad. I think that's where that comes from, but yeah, I think that what everyone is saying is right, that when you really think about the position that you're in, you're probably doing alright if you're having your work stolen. And it's a bummer and if it's being stolen for profit, especially by a big company or even a medium sized company, hold them accountable if you can. But when it comes to just [chuckle] other more sad and desperate attempts at stealing work, I don't have as much of a heart in me to get mad about it anymore, I just kinda feel bad a little bit."

That point to just how difficult it really is to separate inspiration from mimicry, to know where that line is, especially early in your career. And the couple of examples that I can point to is that there is a company here in Baltimore, whose name I will not say. I'm actually not sure if they're still around, but they have been around on and off pretty much since we started Friends of the Web six years ago. They started maybe six or seven months after that and they've been around on and off. And three times now, three separate times, they have essentially, as far as I'm concerned, taken our website and made it their own website. Our actual friendsoftheweb.com, not a website we made, just our actual website, our colors, fonts, very similar graphic elements. And never copied and pasted, always different, but the influence was always so strong that every single time I had to shoot this person an email and be like, \"Hey, look... \""

I think it's in our mutual best interest to find a way to deviate and make some clear separation between us.\" I'm fairly friendly. The second time, I was like \"Hey, second time this has happened. This is... We've put out our new website, six months later you have a new website that looks pretty much the same.\" A little more frustrated. By the third time, I was just like, \"Look, I don't know what to say anymore.\" And I feel like at this point I know this person, the person making the creative decisions for this company, and I know... I'm fairly confident they are not doing this either to troll us or to just be malicious."

But there was this really interesting moment where I was gearing up for senior year, for getting my portfolio ready, apply for jobs or whatever, and I made a nice portfolio website for myself, put a lot of time into it and some personal branding. This is way back in the day when we did personal branding, and then some number of months later, she came to me and was like, \"I finished designing my new website, I'm so excited about it,\" and just showed it to me and I was like, \"This is exactly the same as my website.\""

And it wasn't even like she was hiding it from me and then launched it and then I found it. She came to me and was like \"Look how beautiful this is, I'm so excited about it.\" And we had to have a conversation where I was like, \"Maybe not the exact same highlight color, maybe this kind of grid here,\" whatever the things that were very similar.

He's moved on to do all different kinds of design and now I think he's probably more of an author than he is a designer at this point. He's putting out design books. He's somebody I've admired for my entire career and I feel like his work became prominently visible in the public right around the time that I was looking at a lot of work and trying to find my voice, and so I've had to kinda check myself at points in my life to be like, \"Am I doing this too much the Frank way, or at least attempting to do it too much the Frank way?\""

I don't even want to say it, it's so atrocious. But the point is I did this illustration and I thought to myself, \"I think this is totally fine. I'm 90% sure that this is not just totally cribbing Frank's style, but I'm going to sit on it for a couple months because I'm a little afraid that I'm doing that.\" And a couple months later, it was so blatantly obvious that I had just completely lifted it."

And at the time there was that beautiful poster that Build had made that was the word \"Objectified\" and then below it, it was a bunch of objects are drawn in just silhouette, a bunch of just rendered objects. And I had this brilliant idea where I was gonna do my own take on that because the audience was the design students at my school. They had seen this poster, they were aware of that, it wasn't like it was going out to the larger world. But I had this design in my head that I would do my take on it and what I did was for 24 hours, I kept a notebook with me, before I had a smart phone, and I just noted down every single object that I touched all day, for the entire day. I just kept track of everything. And then I made a poster that was visually similar to that poster, but it was all the things I personally had touched labeled with their time for the day. And I thought this was an interesting take on it, and of course it's not, it's just a total rip off."

At the bottom, I had in small letters, \"Designed by Andy Mangold,\" and then it was hanging up for a little while and then somebody vandalized the poster by scratching out design and writing, \"Stolen,\" on the poster that was hanging up at school."

I kept track of all the things I touched myself personally and then I drew them all, and so it's they're in order by the day.\" And he wrote back and was like, \"Yeah, if you look at the original poster, they're also things in order for the day.\" There's a toothbrush at the beginning, and it's not as obvious 'cause it's not as dumb and blunt as a sophomore graphic design student would make, but it's the exact same idea. So not even my unique idea was actually unique, I just didn't realize it. So we've all put our foot there. And those are my stories of me putting my foot in places where it doesn't belong. And yeah, someone just scratched out, \"Designed by,\" and wrote, \"Stolen by.\""

    content: "Alright. Let's get one more lightning round topic in, and then you, dear audience, will have to just sit and wonder what the other topics that we'll never get to might've been. One of the things on here that we never got to a full episode about, that we did touch on a couple of times in other episodes in passing, is the relationship between design and testing. We're talking about data-driven design. Nowadays we have all kinds of tools and libraries that allow us to measure how people are interacting with the things we're designing very finely and in a very detailed way. We can understand who clicked on what, how long people stay on a page, how many pages they go to before they leave, all kinds of different analytics and things about the designs we're making. And I think more and more people are starting to do robust user testing, where they're trying to decide between maybe two different versions of how a page or a view ought to look. And I'll just open it up, I've talked enough. Who wants to... Who has an opinion about the relationship between design, making a decision for yourself, and using data or analytics to influence your process?"

    timestamp: "41:12"
    speaker: "Linda"
    content: "Well, I think it's... It's a very powerful and awesome thing to do. And I've seen it. I've seen testing move numbers to make companies extra millions of dollars, so I think it's definitely something you should be doing and you shouldn't constantly be this renegade designer who's just like, \"Oh, no. The users don't know what they need.\" I like it when people use that, that Ford quote, \"If I ask people what they wanted, they would've asked for faster horses.\" But I don't really feel like it's like that. I think that you have to have a 50:50 approach to user testing. Sure, do that, and validate, and test and test and test, and iterate, but also get away from the user sometimes and just try to come up with your own ideas and try to have a brain inside your head. I think that if you're too results-focused, you can get a little bit stuck in your own feedback loops where you're just so focused on these little nuanced details that you're completely forgetting about the big picture. But I'd like to hear what you guys have to say about that too."

    timestamp: "42:26"
    speaker: "Maurice"
    content: "Well I think also with data-driven design, that data is often gathered from whatever the respective audience is for that design. So if it's a website for example, whatever the bounce rate is or things like that might be applicable to that particular audience, but that doesn't mean that if you try to... We were talking before about stealing design for example, you won't be able to maybe take that same type of UI pattern or what have you, and replicate it for your site and get the same results."

There's certainly websites and things out there where you'll see best email templates or really good calls to action or things like that because these are things which may have worked for people through some level of trial-and-error. I don't think that the results of data-driven design should really be like a starting... Well I wouldn't even say a starting point, more like an ending point. To say, \"Oh, well we looked at this and it apparently worked for these guys, so we're gonna do the same thing.\" And you may not get those same results. Your results may vary wildly."
  -
    timestamp: "43:38"
    speaker: "Linda"
    content: "It's also really tricky because you have to trust the numbers, but to a certain extent. Like say for example you did email campaigns on the month every single month, and you can test how many opens there were and how well things did and... But from then it's all somewhat speculative because it might have been that your email campaign that you did the month before, once the user opened it, it was actually horrible and they really didn't like it. And so the next month, they're just not even gonna open it, and so then when you test that one, you say, \"Okay, well this was clearly just a bad email.\" But no, that could've actually been your best one. They just didn't get around to opening it because last month's sucked so bad. You still have to kinda go with your gut and realize that you're working with human brains, which are more complicated than that."

    timestamp: "44:31"
    speaker: "Matt"
    content: "Yeah, I think I'm more... I think I always feel like I'm just wary of any sort of... You know those blogs that are like, \"Hey, here are some user tests that other people did, and therefore it's a rule.\" And you're like, \"Well, no,\" because that's so hyper-specific. Even in your own world where you're testing just your site or your product or whatever, it's really hard to tell what the numbers even mean. If you make little tiny tweaks, you can tell what those things mean, but beyond that you're probably... You're probably discovering a lot more without information to let you know what it is. And so when you read those marketing blogs that tell you what color the button's supposed to be and where you're supposed to put it, it's so specific that it's pretty disingenuous. I just don't trust it. But there's certainly reasons to use data, obviously. It would be stupid to say otherwise. You just have to be smart about it and ask very, very, very specific questions because otherwise you're just making huge leaps and you're probably not actually learning anything."

    timestamp: "45:24"
    speaker: "Andy"
    content: "To me, I feel like... More information to influence your decisions is always better, in my view. I don't think we're at a point in design where the average designer has too much information that parsing it becomes too time consuming such that we have to optimize that. And there are jobs where an abundance of information is genuinely a problem and you have to find some way to pair it down because you can't possibly consume all of it. I think when you're a designer making a decision about any kind of product, you should welcome more information because you're not overrun with it, even if you might feel like you are. And so for the designers that are out there using this kind of data to influence their decision-making, I think that's great, and I think that it's important to have an understanding of how statistics works in order to do that, otherwise you run the risk of doing... Using data in the way which is dangerous, which is as a means of avoiding making a decision. As a means of removing the responsibility from yourself and putting it onto some invisible third party. For example, I think a lot of times people will A/B test something just because they don't wanna decide for themselves what the thing... Which one is best for their particular problem or for their brand or for whatever it is they're laying out. In that situation, I think you really run the risk of not understanding why the thing you chose is working the way that it is."

    timestamp: "46:54"
    speaker: "Andy"
    content: "So you can A/B test something and let's assume you have enough traffic that the A/B test is actually meaningful and the difference in the delta between the performance of the two different pages is actually meaningful. Which, frankly, I think a lot of people A/B test things when they don't have the kind of numbers where they can really determine a difference. But let's assume you do, let's assume you have a statistically relevant difference there. You want people to buy the T-shirt or whatever you want them to do, you don't really know why they're buying the T-shirt if you're just making the decision based on which of these perform better and you're not applying a bigger picture rigor to it. And some dumb examples are like you can imagine people might have bought the T-shirt because they didn't see the price and the price was too high and they didn't see it until they hit \"buy\" without knowing how expensive it was gonna be. Or they bought the T-shirt because it was unclear how many they were gonna get or because they felt like there was none in stock, even though there were abundance of things in stock. There's all sorts of deceptive and bad things that can happen there, and if you're not looking at the big picture, you might not know that, \"Oh, with this particular page design when we sold 15% more, but we got 12% more returns.\" So it didn't really..."

    timestamp: "48:02"
    speaker: "Andy"
    content: "It kinda came out in the wash because people are... We don't understand behavior that cleanly. Yeah, I think in a broad view, I wish we could do more actual data-driven stuff on the projects we work on. It is a luxury because you do have to build it and you have to collect the data and you have to have a big enough audience that the data you're collecting is relevant. And short of that, I'm a big fan of qualitative testing instead of quantitative testing. Don't think about whether or not this thing performed 0.2% better over 100,000 views than this other option unless you're really at a scale where that matters, right? Like if you're working at Amazon, you're working at Google, you're working at Facebook, you have to live and die by this stuff, I have to imagine, because you don't have the option of understanding things in any other way because of the enormity of your audience. But if you're making something on a smaller scale, I really feel like there's so much more to be learned from qualitative testing, just watching somebody use the thing that you built and learning about [chuckle] what they're thinking about, what's going through their head when they're clicking through the different pages. That can be, I think, much more illuminating than looking at differences in numbers on spreadsheets."

I guess to sum up what everyone else has said thus far, there's a saying that comparison is the thief to joy, meaning that if you spend so much time comparing and looking at what you have based on what someone else has, it makes it harder for you to see the beauty in the work that you might be doing. So piggy backing again off of what everyone said, take pride in the work that you're doing wherever it is that you are at this point. And it's a new year, or it's about to be a new year, set some goals for yourself, don't stress yourself out if you're not able to actually meet all of said goals, but I feel like it's always good to try to work towards something, whatever that might be, big or small. I don't know. There's a lot of topics out there. I feel like Working File, this podcast has been a great platform for people to have really good discussions around a number of different topics, but if you've been someone that has been listening from the beginning or if you've just jumped on recently, use this as a springboard to take these conversations out into the community and have them with other people. Have other conversations, different conversations than the one we're having. Keep the thread going of always being, I would say, knowledgeable and aware of your surroundings and the community that you work in and all of that good stuff."
