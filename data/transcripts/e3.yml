    content: "Just chilling, composing theme music as you go impromptu, which is, of course, one of your greatest skills. So this week, for the first week of this ever, for the pilot week of this, I wanted to talk specifically about the idea of design in the public eye. It's something that I think we're all consciously aware of. We're all on Twitter here, we all have our various social platforms and whatnot. It's something that I don't think we talk about a lot, that design... Being a designer in lots of different ways, graphic design, working in interfaces, or product design, doing illustration, doing lettering, type design even. All these things are industries that have a lot of visibility to them and that causes this kind of idea that, if you're doing this work, you're supposed to be out there, active on social media, putting the word out about what you're doing."
  -
    timestamp: "03:36"
    speaker: Andy
    content: "And I'm interested in how that... Why that is? Is that just because our industry is a visual industry? So, therefore, people like looking at stuff and we start collecting it and this naturally happens?"

    timestamp: "03:49"
    speaker: Satchell
    content: "Well I'm curious to know because I feel like for whatever reason, I have this perception, feel free to discount it if it's not the case at all that you and Matt, especially having your involvement on this podcast talking about design for as long as you guys have, that you guys have somewhat or at least at some season of life had like a finger on the pulse of, I guess, the design scene and the internet people around it. I'm very aware that it exists, I don't feel a part of it at all, and I never really had a particular interest to pursue the kinds of conversations that were happening there, but I know that it exists. And I'm interested in hearing or knowing more about what that's like. 'Cause I have an idea of what it might look like. There are some designers that I follow on Twitter and stuff and I always hear opinions thrown out here and there, different jokes that surface and stuff."
  -
    timestamp: "04:46"
    speaker: Andy
    content: "Well, it is funny. There was a time where I thought it was very important to follow lots of designers on Twitter. And follow lots of blogs that were posting design work and to really feel like I was in that community and in the mix with what was going on there. And at some point that just completely... I would say probably right around when I graduated maybe four, five years ago, I really kind of stopped doing all of that. Google Reader got cancelled and killed and I no longer had all those blogs I was following. I started unfollowing more designers on Twitter and following more astronauts and other kinds of interesting people that don't do what I do every day for a living. So I feel like I'm actually not in touch with the world as I know it, the world you're kind of describing, right?"

Jen, I know that some people have the perception, I've at least heard people tell this to me, that you're kind in \"the belly of the beast\" in that part of Brooklyn you're in. Your studio is probably a studio that lots of people across the country wish they could work out of with all those talented great people. Do you feel like that... I mean it's true. You have lots of..."

    content: "Do you feel like that's part of life in, being a designer in Brooklyn, that you have this kind of a weird invisibility? Or do you feel like that's not a thing?"
  -
    timestamp: "06:12"
    speaker: Jen
    content: "No, I think you're definitely right. And I think there's a few aspects of this. So right, you were talking about perception. There is definitely the factor of this idea that other people might have of communities that are elsewhere, whether it's in New York City, because you're not from New York City, or if it's just somewhere else completely, entirely. Just because you don't have an idea of what it's like there. So, it is kind of cool that, if I go out to a bar or something, there might be groups of people that I follow and was just having conversation with on Twitter, that actually happened last night. So, it is... I definitely fully enjoy that and I definitely don't take it for granted. When we see each other, it's always very genuine and very wonderful. But then, going back to the idea of perception, that's what I'm really interested in because it's often that'll be like, \"Hey man, this guy might have a bunch of followers on Twitter, but I sit next to him and he's just like a dude.\""

    content: "And I think you're definitely right. There's a little bit of, people trying to feel like, \"Oh, I'm a famous designer or whatever. I have this many thousand followers on Twitter, therefore I'm some big hot shot.\" Which is, I think it's very important to point out that yeah, we're just still this very specific hyper specialized industry doing this particular type of work. And but what I think is interesting is that, a famous dentist, as far as I know, and I could just be really out of the dentist circles."

That may be sought after, maybe they are known as a specialist for a certain type of oral surgery and people come from all over the country to see that one dentist. But that dentist probably isn't as visible as the people that are famous in our industry, or \"famous\" in air quotes in our industry."
  -
    timestamp: "08:42"
    speaker: Jen
    content: "I don't know. I might actually argue against that because I think that there are people within other specialty industries. Neil deGrasse Tyson for instance, has way too many followers than any scientist of his caliber should technically have because science is technically..."

    content: "If there were a dentist, that's as interesting as him, of course he's gonna have that many followers, or they're gonna have that many followers because they're interesting people. So I think that, from our perspective, of course we're gonna look at famous designers differently than a famous dentist, but I truly feel that it's very similar. And maybe there are famous dentists that have plenty of followers on Twitter."
  -
    timestamp: "09:23"
    speaker: Matt
    content: "I mean, I don't know if it's about Twitter followers but doesn't everybody get kind of famous in their field? Or doesn't every field have their own celebrities? Even if you're a famous dentist maybe you're talking at conferences and everybody goes to the conference and you're the keynote speaker every time, we're like, \"Oh, I'm so sick of Steve the dentist. Every single dental conference has him as the keynote speaker.\""
  -
    timestamp: "09:43"
    speaker: Jen
    content: "Absolutely. I think, and that's another interesting thing, is that we as designers are really good at reinventing things and feeling like we've discovered things, and so conferences still feel kind of new, right? Conferences still feel exciting and we've invented this coming together almost. But truthfully, my dad has been going to conferences... Tech conferences since before I was born. So, these kind of social gatherings within industries have always existed. We're just doing it in a slightly maybe more fun way. [chuckle] That I think is accessible to other people who are not within our industry."
  -
    timestamp: "10:22"
    speaker: Matt
    content: "Part of me wonders if we have a little leg up in that... At least we pretend to be really good at communicating or... Especially if on the internet where communication is mostly visual, or lettering or something, that another thing we're supposed to be good at, do we have a leg up on a on the world on that? Because with just being pretty good at the thing that we do, we can communicate pretty well and get a lot of people to follow us, even if we're just a dude or a lady."
  -
    timestamp: "10:48"
    speaker: Satchell
    content: "One thing that I've sort of seen over time that I've taken in passing note of, is there are a lot of people who actively pursue aesthetic excellence in the things that they do and they're very careful about what they curate and not everyone's rewarded for that. I do know a lot of people that might be really compelling film makers or really compelling designers. And I'm looking at the stuff that they're putting out, that's like, \"Whoa, this is great.\" They're really waiting for the diamond in the rough but no one really has any idea... I don't know what it is, if it's just no one really has any idea who they are or because they hold off on that kind of stuff, they're infrequent or whatever, but they clearly know how to communicate with a lot of people. But there isn't a direct correlation between having that clear knowledge and having... I guess what I'll call a mimetic character. Sort of like, I don't wanna say viral."

  -
    timestamp: "11:58"
    speaker: Matt
    content: "Actually, I've wondered if that's a way of being. I feel that is actually oftentimes rewarded online because there becomes the perception that everything this person does is perfect. I feel like that's what builds the character of somebody you would want to follow, somebody you'd see as a celebrity is you see their life is great, you see everything they do is great and there's just no failures visible, which I actually think is a little bit..."

  -
    timestamp: "12:28"
    speaker: Matt
    content: "But, I actually feel like that's a little bit of the problem we have in the design community is that people don't really talk about their failures all that much, so it just seems like everybody you follow on Twitter has a great life and is much better at everything than you."

  -
    timestamp: "12:56"
    speaker: Andy
    content: "Yeah. And I think that to me that's part of it, right? So, even if there is a famous dentist out there that's got a big following and everyone knows this particular dentist, there's something about... You don't go and see that dentist work, maybe at a conference there'll be a presentation about some particular thing that was done, or a new technique, or something."

    speaker: Andy
    content: "[laughter] All sorts of Instagram shots. I think it's something about that visual nature that... And it lends right into this idea of everything is perfect. We all carefully, or at least we're taught to very carefully prune our portfolios, show the best work, show only the best work, and make sure you're really highlighting the most important things. And I think most of us will agree that oftentimes a project looks better in our portfolio than it does in the real world, because of the context we put it in and all that stuff. One aspect of it, it generally, I should say, the fact that we tend to be outward in public in our industry, is something I think is great. You get to meet people, and know people, and follow their thoughts, and you get to actually choose to embed yourself in the community and surround yourself with it, and it's an option available to you."
  -
    timestamp: "14:20"
    speaker: Andy
    content: "I don't know what you do if you're real excited about dentistry. I'm sure there's a journal or something, maybe a forum somewhere, but I don't think it's on the same scale as what we have available to us, so generally I think it's really good. And the one place where I think it gives me a little bit of pause is when I think about students or people that are new designers of any age that are trying to come into this community. And what it's like when you do have... You're projecting this perfection, of your process, your portfolio, you have your shots on Instagram of you sketching by a sunset in a log cabin, and whatever. It seems our tendency to put our best foot forward sometimes puts the industry in a light that almost gives people unattainable expectations for what their work is going to be. Is that a thing?"
  -
    timestamp: "15:07"
    speaker: Satchell
    content: "Yeah. I hear you."
  -
    timestamp: "15:07"
    speaker: Jen
    content: "I would definitely agree with that. I think that's for sure. And I actually feel like we have a responsibility to be a little more self aware not just for ourselves but for younger designers, and for younger people in general who might be interested in this industry. Just because I feel like the reality is... I'm a more practical person but I do think that the reality is more interesting, it's also just more helpful. If a young designer is coming on thinking that they can make a living by just posting sketches on Instagram, they are sorely mistaken. I never want to be someone who puts forth that image and has a image that looks successful via Instagram, but then I have a full-time job doing something completely different. To me that's dishonest, and it's also actually dangerous."
  -
    timestamp: "15:58"
    speaker: Andy
    content: "Yeah. I think it does take a little bit of thoughtfulness to try and consider how what you're putting out there might be perceived by others. That's part of the responsibility that comes along with what is unique about our industry and how it relates to the public. I don't know if that responsibility is something that really falls on other people and I do think it's there though. I don't know how it manifests itself, I don't wanna tell somebody who has a great hobby of doing lettering, or illustrations on their weekends to not put them online because it will seem like that's their job, and to not get a lot of followers."
  -
    timestamp: "16:31"
    speaker: Satchell
    content: "Yeah. I wouldn't want to police how people share things, especially because we turn social networks in as highlight reels regardless, as a creator and then also as someone who's just taking in the content that's in front of us. I guess trying to curate that reaction can be, it sounds like a daunting task, it sounds like a lot of thinking. I definitely agree with the thoughts that are put out there. Andy, what you're describing sounds a lot like the ping pong table in the creative agency, right. You get this idea that people are playing ping pong all day, there's this casual environment, at least that's what I think about. And by no means do I feel like a curmudgeon about it, at least I don't think that I am. I don't feel any..."

    speaker: Satchell
    content: "Yeah. I don't feel any cynical grip on it but I almost wonder... I'd like to believe that the internet like most other things has a series of movements where attitude shift over time but since we're a part of it all the time we don't really see it. And I guess there is a part of me that recently, wonders... And I open this up for anybody to answer. Have we progressed into a season where we're no longer over romanticizing things like that? Because I feel like social media in general has been around to a point where... And I've been taking it in long enough to a point where whenever I see the photo, I can't not see the person taking the photo as well."

    content: "And with that in mind... You know in a lot of ways I wonder, if we are at a point where people are like willing to share mistakes more, because we are out of that movement of having this 100% on message all the time, media trained perspective on being personable with people. Which is actually the opposite of being personable with people."

    timestamp: "18:38"
    speaker: Jen
    content: "I would definitely agree with you. I love the idea of moving through seasons, as far as the way that we interact with each other and I do... And for me I feel like I notice when people are gearing towards optimism, or gearing towards, maybe not pessimism, but something more like realism or pragmatism. And I definitely feel like it's much more personable to be a little more real now, instead of having that perfect life and I think that's really cool. Of course, I do think that, sure you should be self-aware about what you post and what other people might read into it, but yeah you're right, a lot of the responsibility falls on to the viewer to then make assumptions on their own."

Maybe it's a picture of a falling leaf or something you could like apply sadness to it. But it's all like, \"I had a great meal. I went to a great party. I'm on a great vacation.\" Text based mediums, Facebook seems to be an okay place to share sadness sometimes."

And it was this young woman who was facing depression, and I really wish I could remember her name, but she started a hashtag called \"This is What it Looks Like\" and basically any time that she was feeling fully depressed, she just took a picture, whether it was things that she was looking at, of herself, something she was doing and she posted it to Instagram. And you could see in her feed, in her personal feed, her life went from \"highlight reel\" to \"this is what it looks like\" back to \"highlight reel\" back to \"this is what it looks like.\" And it seemed like a real full personality. I just thought that was so impressive."

Design website article about somebody asked a bunch of designers what their goals for 2016 were. And this was a thinly veiled way for a bunch of designers to announce new projects they were working on, or point people to the things they've done in the past and talk about their accomplishments. But right in the middle of it, Dylan Lathrop, who is a designer at BuzzFeed, someone I follow on Twitter for a long time, he wrote three or four beautiful, thoughtful, crushing paragraphs about his depression and how his goal for 2016 is to get better at living with himself. And it was such a perfect portrait of kind of the shallowness and the sort of... This kinda thing we're describing, right, the faux perfection of the design world. In the middle of these 50 tips for what people were gonna do to be more creative and how they were gonna grab the year by the reins, Dylan wrote a very human thing. It was just really amazing."

A higher percentage of people that work in this industry might deal with issues like that. And if that's the case, if that's the thing that we don't actually talk about publicly ever and we're too excited to share our beautiful portfolios and share our beautiful Instagrams we compose with our $60,000 art degrees, I think it's just an interesting relationship we have with the public eye."

I'm going to make a television series about these ideas and try to get people to invested and interested in it.

I feel like I run into designers often that are just very excited to tell you all about how what they do is very important and great and you should like it.

And it's really cool taking that and running with it. Taking a lot of amazing things that books have done, that films have done and finding the analogous movements that are going on in games as well. So, in that way, I enjoy having compassion for a group of people that might not be interested in it, whenever I'm writing something.

Jen, as a freelancer, what is your relationship with this kind of stuff? Do you try and get your work on blogs? Do you think that leads to work?

And so bloggers like her, who were really careful about the content that she creates, suddenly can't make a living. So a lot of blogs disappeared at that point. Luckily she's still making fantastic content and some great blogs have made it through but there's just less content like what we were consuming when we were all less confident designers, I think."

And to be honest, to me, sure it pays off because they have a ton of followers and seem to be happy with that. But for me, I feel like that is not quite giving the people who follow me the respect that they deserve. The intelligence to see through that kind of tactfulness that just is so desperate for followers.

So it sounds like it has been a very important part of your business, your freelance business, establishing your place in the industry, which is kind of what this whole episode is about, right? This idea that you need to have some kind of public thing. No longer is it postcards, now you have some kind of outward presentation of you and your work, and it seems like it's really important in freelancing and I think it kinda bleeds out into people that are not freelancing either, that still feel this kind of pressure to do that. So I guess my question for you is, what would your advice be to a student? Somebody that... Their work is something they know is not, again like you said, their taste is well beyond their work but they also know that if they're ever gonna work in this industry and be a freelancer or be the kind of designer that you are, for example, this is gonna be something that's important to them."

Is it something that you should be doing constantly as you're learning, is it something that you get to a point and you're like, \"Alright now it's good enough, I'm gonna start putting it up there.\" How would you advise somebody in that position?"

    content: "Sure, first off I would love to hear from younger people in general, whether they're designers or not, because the more younger people I meet, the more fascinated I become with social media whether they have latched onto it or completely decided not to. But regardless I feel like for me, the social media thing, the posting online thing, like I said earlier, is something that comes naturally to me. Ever since I was 13, I started putting my really bad art on the internet and it's still there. [laughter]"

    content: "It is still there. If you wanted to find it, you could. And that's just because I was so desperately craved the sense of community that I have now, as a kid. And you know, a lot of kids growing up in suburbia are like that. But, the thing I really wanna stress is that's just me, and if this doesn't come naturally to someone, then they shouldn't do it if they feel uncomfortable putting things on the internet, then they definitely shouldn't do it. There are other ways around it. And I feel like I would never tell a young student that they have to be on Instagram, but if there's someone who would enjoy and get something out of it, then they definitely should because it is truly a very valuable source of self-promotion. There are so many art directors on Instagram who have hired me the next day because I posted something the day before."

    content: "Wow. So real talk, do you think that a student that is maybe just not inclined to do that naturally, do you think that their career will be suffering? I appreciate your understanding that this is not for everybody necessarily. You're excited to do that, you're excited to share yourself with the world. If somebody is not excited about that and you're saying, you know, \"Don't do it if you're not willing to,\" does that make it harder to be a professional illustrator, designer, hand letterer, whatever it is?"

I had a body of fine artwork, and I had a body of hand-lettered, screen-printed posters and I guess you can imagine which one I took. [laughter] And I'm glad I did. But I feel like the tool of social media, of posting your work online, is just too valuable that if you do want to have the success of the illustrators that you're seeing online or of the designers that you're seeing online, you're just gonna have to do it. That's just part of the game now."

    content: "Maybe that's what this all comes down to. Maybe these tools that we've built to interact as human beings, right, like Twitter and Instagram, don't really exist primarily as a method of advertising. I mean I guess when you really get down to it, primarily they do because that's how they both make all their money. But the idea for the average user is not that this is going to be some kind of publishing platform, it's that you're going to share your life with people. Maybe these tools, because they've become so embedded in our daily lives, have basically advantaged people that happen to be very good at them and very natural sharers of things to be more inclined to, or more advantaged to move into industries like the visual arts. Maybe that's what this is all comes down to, just that simple transactional thing of like, \"People will see your work, they will hire you, you will be better at this,\" and then that cycle kind of propagates itself. It's interesting 'cause it's way different than sending out postcards, right? You don't need to be a..."

[chuckle] An art director stands over their trash can with a pile of postcards, and just one by one goes through 'em, toss 'em in, and maybe we'll keep like, three."

    speaker: Andy
    content: "Yeah, I guess the thing I'm really curious about and interested in, is just how that changes what we perceive to be a successful designer or illustrator. Prior to this, you could be successful if you just were very quiet and introverted and you sent your postcards out and you got hired by the New York Times, you got hired by the Washington Post, you do your illustrations, and that was your thing. And now, it seems like it's harder to be that quiet, introverted, more private person and still succeed in the same way."

If there's anyone, it's just, it's not super shocking to me that people whose job it is to make visuals are suddenly thriving in a visual medium and finding ways to make it work for them. I think there are parts of it that can be a little bit dangerous and a little bit scary when everybody just thinks the life you're supposed to lead is a perfect one and there's never any problems and all your work comes out great and all your clients are perfect. But I do agree, that I think we're shifting into being... You're just living the same life on the internet that you're living in real life because there's not a whole lot of separation anymore. And so maybe it just won't be a problem as much because everybody will just feel more free online, 'cause they were raised that way. There's just no other way to be. You don't have an option."
