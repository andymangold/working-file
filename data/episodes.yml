  showNotes: "Our inaugural show is all about the state of the design community, design journalism, and what <em>Working File</em> should be. Chappell Ellison and Maurice Cherry join us for a conversation about the difference between design discourse in public and private spaces. We find out that Andy has high expectations for designers and discuss the nature of criticism across different creative industries. Is there a distinction between criticsm for consumers and criticism for creators? Is the internet even an appropriate medium for critical discourse?"

  showNotes: "On this episode of <em>Working File</em>, which is actually the first one we ever recorded, we&rsquo;re joined by Satchell Drakes and Jen Mussari to discuss being a designer in the public eye. How is being a famous designer different than being a famous dentist? Is one particular personality type or kind of design work rewarded by social media? What are we saying when we only show our polished, perfect selves online?"

For many of us, what was once formal critiques with peers during our education has been replaced by a confusing array of criticism from a variety of people. How does feedback differ when it comes from our clients, our peers, or our superiors?"

  showNotes: "This episode, featuring Linda Eliasen and Jon Gold, addresses the relationship between the design process and production. Does an understanding of the materials and techniques used to manufacture your designs make you a better designer, or hold you back from doing truly innovative work? When should we push limitations of production and when should we just stick with a tried-and-true, established solution?"
