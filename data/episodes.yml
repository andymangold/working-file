  showNotes: "Our inaugural show is all about the state of the design community, design journalism, and what <em>Working File</em> should be. Chappell and Maurice join us for a conversation about the difference between our actual selves and our public persona. We find out that Andy has high expectations for designers and discuss the nature of criticism across different creative industries. Is there a distinction between criticsm for consumers and criticism for creators? Is the internet even an appropriate medium for critical discourse?"

  showNotes: "On this episode of <em>Working File</em>, which is actually the first one we ever recorded, we&rsquo;re joined by Satchell and Jen to discuss being a designer in the public eye. How is being a famous designer different than being a famous dentist? Is one particular personality type or kind of design work rewarded by social media? What are we saying when we only show our polished, perfect selves online?"

  showNotes: "This episode is all about the distinction between working individually and working collaboratively. Gitamba and Meg join us for a discussion where we talk about our preferred work environments, the difference between design education and working as a designer, and conflict resolution amongst coworkers. When should we compromise and when should we stand up for our ourselves?"

  showNotes: "<strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum."
