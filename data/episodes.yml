  showNotes: "Our inaugural show is all about the state of the design community, design journalism, and what <em>Working File</em> should be. Chappell Ellison and Maurice Cherry join us for a conversation about the difference between design discourse in public and private spaces. We find out that Andy has high expectations for designers and discuss the nature of criticism across different creative industries. Is there a distinction between criticsm for consumers and criticism for creators? Is the internet even an appropriate medium for critical discourse?"

  showNotes: "This episode is all about the distinction between working individually and working collaboratively. Gitamba Saila-Ngita and Meg Lewis join us for a discussion where we talk about our preferred work environments, the difference between design education and practicing design professionally, and conflict resolution amongst coworkers and clients. When should we compromise and when should we stand up for our ourselves?"

  showNotes: "On this episode of <em>Working File</em>, which is actually the first one we ever recorded, we&rsquo;re joined by Satchell Drakes and Jen Mussari to discuss being a designer in the public eye. How is being a famous designer different than being a famous dentist? Is one particular personality type or kind of design work rewarded by social media? What are we saying when we only show our polished, perfect selves online?"
